<p>There is one thing that all the
Birds are afraid of, and that is
the thing that will happen when the
Bird That Follows the Cuckoo flies
into the Cuckoo's mouth.</p>

<p>And what will happen then, asks my kind foster-child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Bird that Follows the Cuckoo flies
into the Cuckoo's mouth the World will come to an
end.</p>

<p>All the Birds know that, but not all the People
know it.</p>

<p>Well, one day the Cuckoo was sitting on a bush
and her Mouth was open. The Bird That Follows
the Cuckoo flew straight at it. And into it he must
have flown only for the Boy....</p>

<p>The Boy was in the tree and he flung his cap at
the Cuckoo and he covered the Cuckoo and the
Cuckoo's open mouth.</p>

<p>The Bird That Follows the Cuckoo flew into the
Crow's mouth instead, and the Crow gave that
bird a squeeze, I can tell you. The Cuckoo pushed
off the Boy's cap with her wings and flew into the
forest.</p>

<p>All the Birds of the King's Garden were there
at the time. There were&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Crow, the Woodpecker,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Wren and the Eagle,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And brisk little Sparrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The King-fisher too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my own little Goldfinch.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All the Birds in the King's Garden were overjoyed
that the Bird that Follows the Cuckoo did
not get into the Cuckoo's Mouth.</p>

<p>"What shall we do for the Boy who prevented
the World from coming to an End?" asked the
good-natured Corncrake. She was there too,
but I forgot to mention her.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the Willy-wagtail. "The Boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
who would throw a cap would throw a stone. Do
nothing at all for him."</p>

<p>"I'll sing for him," said the Goldfinch.</p>

<p>"I'll teach him what the Birds say," said the
Crow.</p>

<p>"If he knew the Language of the Birds he would
be like King Solomon," said the Raven.</p>

<p>"Let us make him like King Solomon," said
the Goldfinch.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes," said all the Birds in the King's
Garden.</p>

<p>The Boy had not gone far when the Crow flew
after him and lighted on his shoulder. The Crow
spoke to him in the Boy's own language. The
Boy was surprised. The Crow flew to a standing
stone and went on speaking plain words to
him.</p>

<p>"O," said the Boy, "I didn't know you could
speak."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I know how to speak," said
the Crow, "haven't I, for a hundred years and
more, been watching men and listening to their
words? Why shouldn't I be able to speak?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you can speak well, ma'am," said the
Boy, not forgetting his manners.</p>

<p>"You know one language, but I know many
languages," said the Crow, "for I know what
People say, and I know what all the Birds
say."</p>

<p>The old Crow sat there looking so wise and so
friendly that the Boy began to talk to her at his
ease. And after a while the Boy said, "Ma'am,
do you think I could ever learn what the Birds
say?"</p>

<p>"You would, if you had me to teach you,"
said the Crow.</p>

<p>"And will you teach me, ma'am?" said the Boy.</p>

<p>"I will," said the Crow.</p>

<p>Then every day after that the Crow would sit
upon the Standing Stone and the Boy would stand
beside it. When the Crow had eaten the boiled
potato that the Boy always brought she would
tell him about the languages of the different Birds.
The two were teaching and learning from day to
day, and indeed you might say that the Boy went
to school to the Crow. He learnt the language<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of this Bird and that Bird, and as he learnt their
languages, many's and many's the good story he
heard them tell each other.</p>

<h4>AND HOW FEET-IN-THE-ASHES,
THE SWINEHERD'S SON, CAME
TO FIND IT</h4>

<p>"If we went there, if we
went there, maybe we'd
find it," said the Cock-grouse
to the Hen-grouse as they went
together, clucking through the
heather.</p>

<p>"And if we found it, if we
found it, what good would the
Stone of Victory do us?" said
the Hen-grouse to the Cock-grouse,
answering him back.</p>

<p>"And what good did the
Stone of Victory do to the
youth who was called Feet-in-the-Ashes,
and who was
only the Swineherd's Son?"
said the Cock-grouse to the
Hen-grouse.</p>

<p>"Tell me, tell me, and then I shall know," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the Hen-grouse to the Cock-grouse, answering him
back. They went together, clucking through the
heather and the Boy who knew what the Birds
said followed them.</p>

<p>He lay upon a rock and the Cock-grouse and
the Hen-grouse discoursed below him, the Cock-grouse
always lifting his voice above the hen's.
The Boy heard what they said and he remembered
every word of it. And, by the tongue in my mouth,
here is the story he heard:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Cluck-ee, Cluck-ee, cluck-ee, cloo, cloo, cloo."
The King of Ireland stood outside the gate of his
Castle and his powerful captains and his strong-armed
guards were all around him. And one of
his captains went to the mound before him and
he gave a shout to the East and a shout to the
West, and a shout to the North and a shout to
the South. When the King asked him why he
did it the Captain said "I want the four quarters
of the World to know that the King of Ireland
stands here with his powerful Captains and his
strong armed guards that no one dare come from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the East or West, the North or the South and lay
the weight of a finger upon him." And when he
said this the other captains flashed their swords
and the guards clashed their shields and the King
of Ireland said, "Well and faithfully am I guarded
indeed and luckier am I than any other King on
the earth for no one can come from the East or
the West, the North or the South and lay the
weight of their finger upon me."</p>

<p>But no sooner did he say that than they saw
a Giant coming across the hill and towards the
place where they were standing. And when the
Giant came to them he lifted up his hand and he
doubled his hand into a fist and he struck the
King of Ireland full in the mouth and he knocked
out three of his teeth. He picked the King's teeth
up, put them in his pouch, and without one word
walked past them and went down to the sea.</p>

<p>"Who will avenge the insult put upon me?"
said the King of Ireland, "and which of my captains
will go and win back for me the three best
teeth I had?" But not one of his captains made
a step after the Giant.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>"I know now," said the King, "How well you
serve and how well you guard me. Well, if none
of you will help me and if none of you will avenge
me, I'll find those who will. And now I'll make
a proclamation and I'll solemnly declare that whoever
avenges the insult offered to me, and, in addition
brings back to me the three that were the
best teeth in my head, even though he be a servant
or the son of a servant, I'll give him my daughter
in marriage and a quarter of my kingdom, and,
more than that," said he, "I'll make him full
captain over all my guards."</p>

<p>The proclamation was sent all over the Castle
and in the end it came to the ears of the Swineherd's
Son who was called Feet-in-the-Ashes.
And when he heard it he rubbed the ashes out of
his hair and he said to his grandmother&mdash;"If there
is anything in the world I want it is the King's
daughter in marriage and a quarter of the Kingdom.
I'll want provision for my journey," said he,
"so, grandmother, bake a cake for me." "I'll do
better than that for you, honey, if you are going
to win back the King's teeth and marry the King's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
daughter," said his grandmother. "I have a few
things of my own that no one knows anything
about, and I'll give them to you with your cake.
Here," said she, "is my crutch. Follow the Giant's
tracks until you come to the sea, throw the crutch
into the sea and it will become a boat, step into
the boat and in it you can sail over to the Green
Island that the Giant rules. And here's this pot
of balsam. No matter how deep or deadly the
sword-cut or the spear-thrust wound is, if you
rub this balsam over it, it will be cured. Here's
your cake too. Leave good-luck behind you and
take good-luck with you, and be off now on your
journey."</p></div>

<p>"And why was the youth called Feet-in-the-Ashes?"
said the Hen-grouse to the Cock-grouse.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He was called Feet-in-the-Ashes because he
had sat in the chimney-corner from the time
he could stand upon two legs. And everybody
who called him Feet-in-the-Ashes thought he
was too lazy to do anything else. Well, he left
good-luck behind him and he took good-luck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
with him and he started off on his journey with
the cake, the crutch and the cure. He followed
the Giant's tracks until they came down to the
sea. Into the sea he flung his grandmother's
crutch. It became a boat with masts and sails.
He jumped into the boat, and the things that
had to be done in a boat were done by him&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He hoisted the sails&mdash;the red sail, the black sail and the speckled sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave her prow to the sea and her stern to the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue sea was flashing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green sea was lashing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on they went with a breeze that he himself would have chosen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the little creatures of the sea sat up on their tails to watch his going.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>and so he went until he came near the Green
Island where Shamble-shanks the Giant who had
carried off the three teeth of the King of Ireland
had his Castle and his stronghold.</p>

<p>He fastened his boat where a boat should be
fastened and he went through the Island until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
he came to a high grey Castle. No one was about
it and he went through it, gate, court and hall.
He found a chamber where a fire burned on the
hearth-stone. He went to the fire gladly. He
looked around the chamber and he saw three beds.
"There's room to rest myself here, at all events,"
said Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>Night came on and he left the fire and got into
a bed. He pulled one of the soft skins over him.
Just as he was going to turn on his side to sleep
three youths came into the chamber. Feet-in-the-Ashes
sat up on the bed to look at
them.</p>

<p>When they saw him they began to moan and
groan and when he looked them over he saw they
were all covered with wounds&mdash;with spear-thrusts
and with sword-cuts. The sight of him in the bed,
more than their wounds, made them moan and
groan, and when he asked them why this was so
the first of the three youths said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We came here, the three of us, to fight the
Giant Shamble-shanks and to take from this Island
the Stone of Victory. We came to this Castle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
yesterday and we made three beds in this chamber
so that after the combat we might rest ourselves
and be healed so that we might be able to
fight the Giant again to-morrow or the day after,
for we know that we cannot win victory over
him until many combats. Now we come back
from our first fight and we find you in one of the
beds we had made. We are not able to put you
out of it. One of us must stay out of bed and the
one that stays out will die to-night. Then we
shall be only two against the Giant and he will
kill us when we come to combat again." And
when the first one had said all this the three youths
began to moan and groan again.</p>

<p>Feet-in-the-Ashes got out of bed. "You can
have your rest, the three of you," said he. "And
as for me I can sit by the fire with my feet in the
ashes as often as I did before." The three youths
got into the three beds and when they were in them
Feet-in-the-Ashes took the pot of balsam that his
grandmother had given him and rubbed some of
it on each one of them. In a while their pain and
their weariness left them and their wounds closed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
up. Then the three youths sat up in their beds and
they told Feet-in-the-Ashes their story.</p></div>

<p class="figright" style="width: 228px;">
<img src="images/image029.png" width="228" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>"Cluck-ee, cluck-ee,
cluck-ee, cluck, cluck,"
said the Hen-grouse, "and
what was the story they
told?"</p>

<p>"Cluck, cluck," said the
Cock-grouse, "wait until
you hear, cluck, cluck."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Said the first of these youths. "On this island
there is a moor, and on that moor there is a stone,
and that stone is not known from other stones,
but it is the Stone of Victory. The Giant Shamble-shanks
has not been able to find it himself, but
he fights with all who come here to find it. To-day
we went to the moor. As soon as we got there
the Giant came out of the Grey Castle and fought
with us. We fought and we fought, but he
wounded us so sorely that we were like to die of
our wounds. We came back to rest here. Thanks
to your balsam we are cured of our wounds. We'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
go to fight the Giant to-morrow, and with the
surprise he'll get at seeing us before him so soon
we may be able to overcome him."</p>

<p>"And along with the surprise, there's another
thing that will help you," said Feet-in-the-Ashes,
"and that is myself. I have to fight the same Giant
Shamble-shanks and I may as well fight him in
company as alone."</p>

<p>"Your help will be welcome if you have not come
here to win the Stone of Victory."</p>

<p>"Not for the Stone of Victory I have come,
but to win back the three teeth that were knocked
out of the King of Ireland's head and to avenge
the insult that was offered to him."</p>

<p>"Then we'll be glad of your help, good comrade."
The three youths got out of their beds
and they sat with Feet-in-the-Ashes round the fire
and the four spent a third of the night in pleasant
story-telling, and slumber nor weariness did
come near them at all.</p></div>

<p>"Cluck, cluck, cluck," said the Hen-grouse.</p>

<p>"Say no more," said the Cock-grouse, "for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
now I'm coming to what's wonderful in my
story&mdash;"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The four youths were seated round the fire
when a little man came into the Chamber. He
carried a harp in his hands. He bowed low to
each of the four of them. "I am MacDraoi,
the Giant's Harper," he said, "and I have come
to play music for you." "Not one tune do we
want to hear from you," said Feet-in-the-Ashes.
"Whether you want it or not, one you will hear,"
said the Harper, "and that tune is the Slumber
Tune. I shall play it for you now. And if the
whole world was before me when I play it, and if
every one in it had the pains of deep wounds, the
playing on my harp would make each and every
one of them fall into a slumber." "That tune
we must not hear," said the first of the three
youths, "for if we fall into a slumber the Giant
will see to it that we shall never awaken."</p>

<p>MacDraoi, the Giant's Harper put his harp to
his chest and he began to play. Slumber came on
the eyelids of the four who were at the fire. Three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
sprang up, but one stayed on his bench dead-sound-fast
asleep. One yawned and fell down on the
floor. One of the two that remained went towards
the Harper, but on his way he fell across a
bed and he remained on it. Then, out of the four,
only one, Feet-in-the-Ashes, was left awake.</p>

<p>The Harper played on. Feet-in-the-Ashes put
his fingers in his mouth and commenced to gnaw
them. He gnawed the first two fingers down to
their joints. But still his mouth kept open in a
yawn and still the slumber kept heavy on his eyelids.
He gnawed his third and his little finger.
Then he put his right hand in his mouth and he
bit at his thumb and he bit so sharply that his
senses nearly all came back to him. With a kick
he knocked the harp out of the Harper's hands.
He caught MacDraoi then and turned him head
below heels and left him hanging by his feet from
a beam across the chamber. Then he went straight
through the hall and out of the Castle.</p>

<p>A wet breeze was blowing and whatever sleep
was on his eye it blew away. He walked on with
the dark clouds of the night going behind him and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the bright light of the day growing before him.
"I'll turn back," said he, "when I hear a cock
crowing, and whatever I find beside me then I'll take
with me to remind myself of where I have been."</p>

<p>He found himself on a moor and he walked on
until he was far on it. A cock crew. "Time
to turn back," said Feet-in-the-Ashes. He looked
round to see what he might bring with him and he
saw on the ground a round stone.</p></div>

<p>"A round stone?" said the Hen-grouse.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Cock-grouse, "a round black
stone. He took it up, that round black stone, and
he went back to the Castle, hungry for his breakfast."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the Castle Chamber the three youths were
still slumbering, one on the bench, one on the
floor and one in a bed and MacDraoi the Harper
was still hanging by his feet from the beam across
the Chamber. "Lift me down from this, good
lad," said the Giant's Harper.</p>

<p>"I will," said Feet-in-the-Ashes, "when my
three companions awaken."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"They won't awaken," said MacDraoi the
Harper.</p>

<p>"Then you can hang there," said Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>"They won't awaken," said MacDraoi, "until
I cause them to awaken, and I shall cause them
to awaken if you lift me down from this."</p>

<p>"Will you promise by your head," said Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>"By my head I promise," said the Giant's
Harper.</p>

<p>Then Feet-in-the-Ashes lifted the Harper down
from the rafters and set him upon his legs. MacDraoi
took up the harp and he pulled the strings
back-ways. The notes he drew out were so piercing
that first one and then another and then a third of
the three youths wakened up. Then, when they
were on their feet MacDraoi, the Giant's Harper,
slipped out of the house and went away. What
happened to the Harper after that no one knows.</p></div>

<p>"Cluck, cluck," said the Hen-grouse, "and what
did they do after that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"The next thing they had to do," said the Cock-grouse,
drawing himself up, "was to fight. Yes,
my lady, to fight." The Hen-grouse drooped her
head and said no more, and the Cock-grouse went
on valiantly&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Swords they drew out&mdash;the three youths who
were with Feet-in-the-Ashes. They sharpened
these swords. They marched off towards the moor
with the swords in their hands. Feet-in-the-Ashes
had no sword. All he had in his hand was a holly-stick.</p>

<p>When they came in sight of the Grey Castle
they saw the Giant come rushing out of the gate.
He was clad all in iron and he had a sword in one
hand and a spear in the other. The four youths
spread themselves out so that they might be able
to close round the Giant. But for all his bigness
the Giant was quick enough. He struck one of
them with his spear and brought him down on his
knees. He struck the other with his sword and
brought him down on his side. He struck the
other with his iron-covered hand and brought
him down on his back. And all that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
left now was Feet-in-the-Ashes with his holly-stick.</p>

<p>What could a youth with a holly-stick in his
hand do against a Giant that had a spear and a
sword in his hands and was besides that all covered
with iron? Feet-in-the-Ashes turned and ran.
He ran towards the Castle and went round it.
And when he was at the east side the Giant was
at the North and when he was at the south the
Giant was at the East. Round and round the
Castle they went and the Giant with his strength
and his quickness was wearing out Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>Feet-in-the-Ashes wanted something to fling
at him. He took the stone out of his pocket&mdash;the
round black stone. He held it in his hand.
He made three circles in the air with it. He flung
the stone. It struck the Giant on the breast and
the iron rang as the stone struck it. Down fell the
Giant. Feet-in-the-Ashes ran off to where his
companions lay. Many times he looked back but
he did not see the Giant following him. The
three youths were lying in their wounds and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
their pain. Feet-in-the Ashes took out his pot of
balsam and rubbed them all over. Their wounds
healed. First one stood up and then the second
stood up and then the third stood up and the
three were whole and well. "Where is the Giant?"
each of them asked.</p>

<p>"Lying where he fell," said Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>"And who threw him down?" said the first
of the youths.</p>

<p>"I threw him down with a cast of a stone,"
said Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>"Let us go and see," said the second of the
youths. They went towards the west side of the
Grey Castle like men following a bear who might
turn on them. The Giant was lying still. "He
is dead," said one, "He is dead indeed," said another.
"He is dead forever," said a third. "He
is dead by the cast of my stone," said Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>They went up to where the Giant was and
looked all over him. "There is the stone that
overthrew him," said one of the youths, "that
round black stone. Where did you get it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the moor," said Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>"On the moor," said the others looking at him.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Feet-in-the-Ashes, "Picked it up
this morning on the moor just as the cock crew."</p>

<p>One of the three youths took the round black
stone in his hand. "I'll bring the stone with
me," said he. "We'll go into the Castle now and
see what our finding there will be."</p>

<p>They went into the Castle. The three youths
told Feet-in-the-Ashes they would help him to
find what he had come to seek&mdash;the three teeth
out of the head of the King of Ireland. They
searched and they searched all over the Castle.
At last one of them opened an iron press and there
on a shelf was a silver cup and in the cup were three
teeth. Feet-in-the-Ashes knew they were what
he had come for. He left the cup beside him.</p>

<p>They took provisions from the Giant's store,
put them on the table and began to eat. But
first one and then another and then the third of
the three youths made an excuse and left the
table. Feet-in-the-Ashes went on with his breakfast.
Then he left the Castle to look for the three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
youths that had been his companions. He did
not find them. He went down to the sea-shore.
He saw his boat and the sails were raised on it.
In the boat were the three youths and they were
making ready to put out to sea. Feet-in-the-Ashes
shouted to them. Then one of the youths
came to the side of the deck and spoke back
to him.</p>

<p>"You found the Stone of Victory without
knowing it," said he, "and you let us take it in
our hands. Now we cannot give it back to you
for our lives depend on our keeping it and bringing
it away. And," said he, "we fear to stay on
the land with you because you have such luck that
you could take the Stone from us. The boat we
came in is gone. We take your boat and we think
that you have such luck that you will find another
way of getting off the island. Remember
that what you came for was not the Stone of
Victory but the King's teeth, and we helped to
find them for you."</p>

<p>They had hoisted the sails and now a wind came
and the boat that was from his grandmother's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
crutch was blown out of the harbour and Feet-in-the-Ashes
was left without any companion on
the Island.</p></div>

<p>"Cluck, cluck, cluck," said the Hen-grouse,
"he found the Stone of Victory, but what good
were his findings to
him when he didn't
know what he had
found and he let it be
taken from him?"</p>

<p class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/image040.png" width="200" height="114" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>"But if he hadn't to find it he couldn't have
slain the Giant and taken the cup out of the iron
cupboard&mdash;that much good the Stone of Victory
did him," said the Cock-grouse.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to think that that's all he got from
the Stone of Victory," said the Hen-grouse.</p>

<p>"Well, that's all he got from it, and be quiet
now till I tell you the rest of the story," said the
Cock-grouse.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He went into the courtyard of the Grey Castle
and he found there a great eagle that was chained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
to a great rock. The eagle came towards him as
far as the chain would let him. "Feed me,"
said the eagle.</p>

<p>"Will you carry me to Ireland's ground if I
feed you?" said Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>"If you feed me every time I open my mouth,
I will," said the eagle.</p>

<p>"That I'll try to do, good eagle," said Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>He went through courtyard and pen-fold but
not a sheep nor a pig nor a bullock could he find.
It seemed as if he would not be able to find meat
for the eagle after all. He went down to the sea-shore
and he came upon a pool filled with thin
bony fish called skates. He took a basket of
these and put it on his back. He came back to
the courtyard and he unlocked the chain that
held the eagle.</p>

<p>"Feed me," said the eagle, and he opened
his mouth.</p>

<p>"Close your eyes and I'll fill you mouth," said
Feet-in-the-Ashes.</p>

<p>The eagle closed his eyes. Feet-in-the-Ashes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
flung a score of skates into his mouth. "Hard
meat, hard meat," said the eagle, but he gulped
them down. Feet-in-the-Ashes, holding the
cup in his hands and carrying the basket of
skates on his back, put himself between the
wings of the eagle. The eagle flew up and over
the Grey Castle and faced for the plain of the
sea.</p>

<p>They travelled from the morning light until
the full noontide. The eagle opened his mouth
again. Feet-in-the-Ashes put nothing into it.
The eagle finding nothing in his mouth dropped
down to the sea.</p>

<p>"Close you eyes," said Feet-in-the-Ashes, "and
I'll fill your mouth." The eagle closed his eyes
and Feet-in-the-Ashes put another score of skates
into his mouth. The eagle gulped them all down.
"Whenever I open my mouth you will have to
feed me," he said. Feet-in-the-Ashes did not
like to hear this, for a score more of skates were
all that was left.</p>

<p>The eagle rose up again and on and on he flew
until the night was coming over the water. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
opened his mouth again. Feet-in-the-Ashes put
in five more skates. The eagle kept his mouth
open and said "Feed me."</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done then but to put
in the rest of the skates. Feet-in-the-Ashes flung
them all in, and the eagle rose up and flew and
they travelled while there was darkness on the
water, and when the sun rose again Feet-in-the-Ashes
saw they were flying over the land of Ireland.
The eagle opened his mouth. Feet-in-the-Ashes
had nothing to put into it. "Fly on,
good eagle," said he, "and leave me down at the
King's Castle." "Feed me," said the eagle. "I
will give you what you never had before&mdash;a whole
bullock&mdash;when we come to the King's Castle."
"Cows far off have long horns," said the eagle
mocking him. With that he flung Feet-in-the-Ashes
off his back.</p>

<p>Sore would his fall have been if it had been on
any other place but a soft bog. On the softest
of soft bogs he fell. He made a hole in the ground,
but no bone in his body was broken and he still
held the cup in his hands. He rose up covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
with the mud of the bog, and he started off for
the King's Castle.</p></div>

<p>"Cluck, cluck," said the Hen-grouse, "and did
he not go to see his grandmother at all?"</p>

<p class="figright" style="width: 217px;">
<img src="images/image044.jpg" width="217" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If he did it's not in the story," said the Cock-grouse.
"That very day, as I would have you
know, the King was standing outside the gate
of his Castle with his powerful captains and his
strong-armed guards around him. 'A
year it is to-day,' said the King, 'since
the Giant came and struck me in the
mouth, knocking out and taking
away three of my teeth,
and since that day I
have had neither health
nor prosperity. And
you know,' said he,
'that my daughter
and a quarter of my
Kingdom is to go to the
one who will avenge
the insult and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
bring back my three teeth.' 'Such and such a
thing prevented me from going,' said one of his
Captains, 'but now that so and so is done, I can
go and avenge the insult offered to you.' 'So and
so kept me from going,' said another of the Captains,
'but now that such and such a thing is done
I can go to-morrow and bring you back your three
teeth.' 'I am tired of hearing you all talk,' said
the King, 'and it's my belief that my teeth will
be lost and my daughter unwedded till the day of
doom.'"</p>

<p>It was then that Feet-in-the-Ashes appeared
before them, "Good health to you, King," said
he.</p>

<p>"Good health to you, good man," said the
King, "and what, may I ask, have you come
here for?"</p>

<p>He was covered with the feathers of the eagle
and the mud of the bog, and, as you may be sure,
the King and the captains and the guards looked
sourly at him.</p>

<p>"I have come first of all, King," said he, "to
give you advice."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what is your advice?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"My advice to you is that you send away all
these you have around you&mdash;your captains and
your guards&mdash;and that you turn them into dog-boys
or horse-boys or anything else in which
they would give useful service, for as they are
here, they can neither serve nor guard you."</p>

<p>"All that may be true," said the King, "but
what right have you to say it?"</p>

<p>Feet-in-the-Ashes said nothing but he held the
cup up to the King and the King saw three teeth
in it and he took them out and placed them in his
mouth and the teeth went into their places and
there firmly they stayed.</p>

<p>Then Feet-in-the-Ashes told how he had gone
to the Green Island and how he had avenged
the insult offered to the king and how he had
got what he had gone to search for. Then he demanded
the King's daughter in marriage and a
quarter of the Kingdom, and both were made over
to him on the spot. As for the powerful captains
and the strong-armed guards, some of them were
made horse-boys and some were made dog-boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and Feet-in-the-Ashes was made Captain over the
new guards. When he came to rule a quarter of
the Kingdom he was given a horse and made a
duke and he was called by a better name than
Feet-in-the-Ashes. But what that name was I
don't remember now.</p></div>

<p>"Cluck, cluck, cluck," said the Hen-grouse, "and
did he go to visit the grandmother at all?"</p>

<p>"If he did," said the Cock-grouse, "that's
another story, and if it was ever told I don't
remember it. Pray go to the right, my lady, for
I'm hungry for the sweet buds of the heather."</p>

<p>The thirteen little wrens sat
on the Apple-yard wall in
the King's Garden and their
mother was there to teach them
to fly. One called them the
little wrens, but really each one
was as big as their mother.
She had a tail, however, that
was most cunningly cocked and
they had no tails, and the consequence
was that when they
made their little flights they
always went sideways. Moreover,
their beaks were still yellow
and wide and open and
this is always a sign of the
young bird.</p>

<p>"All I ask of you," said the
mother, "is that when you go into the World you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
remember that you are the Children of the King of
the Birds."</p>

<p>"Now why does our Mother call us the Children
of the King of the Birds?" said one little wren to
the other. "I think we're really very small. And
I think our Mother is very small. And there's our
Father behind that ivy-leaf and he's very small too."</p>

<p>"And wherever you go, be sure to conduct
yourselves like the Children of the King of the
Birds," said the Mother.</p>

<p>"It's because we were reared in such a fine nest,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
said another little wren. "No other birds in the
world had ever a finer nest than we have had.
That's the reason we're called the Children of the
King of the Birds."</p>

<p>"Men call the Wren the King of the Birds,"
said the Father Wren, as he flew up on a tree,
"and surely men ought to know who is the King
of the Birds."</p>

<p>"Why do men call the Wren the King of the
Birds?" said the little wrens.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said the Mother. "As we fly
from the wall to the tree, and from the tree back
to the wall, I will tell you why men honor the wren
as the King of the Birds."</p>

<p>She spent a whole day telling the little wrens
the story and the Boy Who Knew What the Birds
Said was there, and he heard the whole of it.&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The King of the Hither-side of the Mountain
conquered the two villages of Half-a-Loaf and
Windy-Gap, and the very day he conquered
he ordered the two Headmen to come before him.</p>

<p>"You two Headmen are to see that your villages,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Half-a-Loaf and Windy-Gap, send me my rightful
tribute," said the King to them.</p>

<p>"There isn't much we can send...." said the
Headman of Half-a-Loaf.</p>

<p>"A string of salmon," said the Headman of
Windy-Gap.</p>

<p>"A basket of plover's eggs," said the Headman
of Half-a-Loaf.</p>

<p>"No," said the King, "the tribute that each
of your villages must send me is the King of the
Birds."</p>

<p>The two Headmen went back to their villages,
and that very day each told at the council what
tribute the King had ordered them to send. "The
King of the Birds," said the people of Half-a-Loaf,
"that's the Eagle surely." "The King of the
Birds," said the people of Windy-Gap. "What
Bird might that be? We'll have to give thought
to this."</p>

<p>The people of Windy-Gap thought about it and
thought about it, but the people of Half-a-Loaf
declared there was no doubt at all about it&mdash;the
Eagle was the King of the Birds. And while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
people of Windy-Gap were thinking and pondering
the people of Half-a-Loaf were sending their
young men off to catch an eagle.</p>

<p>But an eagle is a hard fowl to catch, and the
people of Half-a-Loaf found they had to send all
of their young men out and to send them out
every day. And the young men climbed high hills
and stony ditches, and they searched the east
and they hunted the west; they went out at sunrise
and they came back at sunset, but never an
eagle did they bring with them.</p>

<p>"It may be that the Eagle is the King of the
Birds," said the people of Windy-Gap, "but we
had better consider it."</p>

<p>They thought about it from sunrise to sunset;
they thought about it while they plowed their
fields and sowed them, while they spun their cloth
and made their coats, while they mended their
nets and mended their shoes, while they thatched
their roofs and planted their apple-trees.</p>

<p>And in Half-a-Loaf there was few left to plow
the fields and sow them, to spin cloth and to make
coats, to mend nets and to mend shoes, to thatch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
roofs and to plant apple-trees&mdash;there was few left
to do these things for all the young men were out
on the mountain hunting for an eagle.</p>

<p>"The people of Windy-Gap will be ruined,"
said the people of Half-a-Loaf, "they have done
nothing yet to catch the Eagle. When the King
gets no tribute from them he'll come down and
sell them and their village. Call the young men
back that have gone into the fields to work and
send them up the mountain again."</p>

<p>At last the people of Half-a-Loaf caught their
Eagle&mdash;a great golden Eagle he was. They built
for him a shed and they fed him on what lambs
they had that year.</p>

<p>"We're safe anyway," said the people of Half-a-Loaf,
"but the unfortunate folk in Windy-Gap
have lost their chance. They'll not have time to
catch an eagle now."</p>

<p>The time was coming near when the two
villages would have to send their tribute to the
King.</p>

<p>"We have our Eagle," said the people of Half-a-Loaf,
"But O, Bad Fortune! we have hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
a crop growing. This will be a hard year for us&mdash;we
haven't lambs to grow into sheep even."</p>

<p>"We have our crops," said the people of Windy-Gap,
"but, Bad Cess to it! What are we to do
about paying our tribute to the King?"</p>

<p>And still they couldn't decide whether it was
the Eagle or the Cuckoo or the Woodpecker that
was King of the Birds. They were still considering
it when the King's Messenger came to bid
them come with their tribute to the King's Castle.</p>

<p>What were the people of Windy-Gap to do?
They searched round and about but no bird at all
could they find. And then as he was being marched
off the Headman put his hand under the thatch
of his house and took out a Wren that was sheltering
there. He put the Wren under his hat and
went off with the King's Messenger.</p>

<p>And there, before him on the way to the King's
Castle was the Headman of Half-a-Loaf. The
riders of the village were with him and they bore
their golden Eagle most triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Give to my Falconer the King of the Birds,"
said the King.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>The Headman of Half-a-Loaf presented the
Eagle.</p>

<p>"It is well," said the King, "and where have
you," said he to the Headman of Windy-Gap,
"bestowed the King of the Birds?"</p>

<p>The Headman put his hand under his hat
and handed over the Wren to the King's Falconer.</p>

<p>"Tush," said the King, "Why do you call this
the King of the Birds?"</p>

<p>The Headman of Windy-Gap was going to say
"Because his family is great," but he said instead
"Because he flies the highest, my lord."</p>

<p>"If it be truth it's unknown to me," said the
King, "but it shall be tried out."</p>

<p>Then said he to the Royal Falconer, "Let the
Eagle and the Wren soar together. And when the
Eagle outsoars the Wren it shall be proved that
the Headman of Windy-Gap is a catiff, and his
village and everyone in it will be sold to the Saracens.
But if it so happens that the Wren outsoars
the Eagle, the tribute sent from the village of
Windy-Gap must be accepted."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>The Eagle and the Wren rose from the same
perch and soared up together. Up and up the
Eagle went. "So far my father went, but I shall
go farther," said the Eagle. Higher and higher
he rose. "So far my grandfather went but I shall
go farther." Farther and farther he soared. "So
far went my great-grandfather, and no eagle again
will fly so high." His wings were stiff and tired.
"No bird will ever out-soar this flight of mine,"
said the Eagle.</p>

<p>He went to close his wings so that he might rest
them as he went down. But as he did the Wren
came from under his wings.</p>

<p>Up went the Wren, down went the Eagle. Up
and up went the Wren. He had been resting while
the Eagle had been flying, and now he was able
to soar past the point the Eagle had reached at
his dead-best.</p>

<p>The Eagle flew down and lighted on the Falconer's
perch. "Has he flown high, Falconer?"
asked the King. "No bird has flown so high,"
said the Falconer. "By the rime on his wings he
has gone into the line of frost."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Eagle is King of the Birds and no one can
deny it," said the King. "The village of Windy-Gap
has not sent me my tribute."</p>

<p>"Mercy," said the Headman of Windy-Gap.</p>

<p>"The village and all in it shall be sold to the
Saracens," said the King.</p>

<p>Just then the Wren came down and lighted on
the perch beside the Eagle. "Where did the Wren
fly to?" said the King. "By my glove," said the
Falconer "he soared past the line of frost, and
went into the line of snow, for what's on his feathers
is a drop of snow."</p>

<p>"The Wren is King of the Birds," said the
Headman of Windy-Gap.</p>

<p>"Yes, King of the Birds," said the King, "and,
therefore, my lawful tribute."</p>

<p>And so, for ever after the villages sent to the
King, not an Eagle, but a Wren as tribute. And
in no village ever after were the lands unplowed
and the fields unsown, the cloth unspun and the
coats not made, the roofs unthatched and the
apple-trees unplanted. And in every village in
the hollow and on the height the people shouted
for the Wren&mdash;"The Wren, the Wren, the King
of all Birds."</p>

<p>Bloom-of-youth was
a young, young girl.
But, young as she was, she
would have to be married,
her step-mother said. Then
married she was while she was
still little enough to walk
through the doorway of her
step-mother's hut without
stooping her head.</p>

<p>Her husband was a hunter
and he took her to live in a
hut at the edge of a wood.
He was out hunting the
whole of the day. Now what
did Bloom-of-Youth do while
she had the house to herself?
Little enough indeed. She
swept the floor and she washed the dishes and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
laid them back on their shelf. Then she went to
the well for pails of water. When she went out she
stayed long, for first she would look into the well
at her own image and then she would make a
wreath of flowers and put it on her head and look
at herself again. After that, maybe, she would
delay to pick berries and eat them. Then she
would go without hurrying along the path, singing
to herself.&mdash;</p>

<p>When she would have got back to the hut the fire
on the hearth would have gone out and she would
have to light it again and then sweep the floor
clear of the ashes that had blown upon it. After
that she would have little time to do anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
else except prepare a meal against the time when
her husband would be back from his hunting.</p>

<p>One morning her husband left his coat down
on the bench. "My coat is torn; sew it for me,"
he said. Bloom-of-Youth said she would do that.
But she did no more to the coat than take it up
and leave it down again on the bench.</p>

<p>The next day her husband said "My vest is
torn too; have it and the coat sewn for me."
He left the vest beside the coat and went out to
his hunting.</p>

<p>Bloom-of-Youth did nothing to the coat and
nothing to the vest, and every day for a week her
husband went out without coat or vest upon him.</p>

<p>One day he put on his torn coat and his torn vest
and went out to his hunting. When he came home
that evening he had a bundle of wool with him.</p>

<p>"Your step-mother," said he, "sends you this
bundle of wool and she bids you spin it that
there may be cloth for new clothes for me." "I
will spin it," said Bloom-of-Youth.</p>

<p>But the next day when her husband went away
she did what she had always done before. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
went to the well and she looked for long at her
image; she put a wreath of flowers on her head
and she looked at her image again; she picked
berries and ate them; she went along the path
without hurrying, singing to herself.&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Said when he saw</span><br />

</p>

<p>She had to light the fire again when she came in
and sweep away the ashes that had gathered on
the floor and after she had done all that it was
time to prepare the meal for the evening. But
before her husband came home she took the spinning
wheel out of the corner and put it near the
light of the doorway.</p>

<p>"I see," said her husband, "that you are going
to spin the wool for my clothes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am when to-morrow comes," said Bloom-of-Youth.</p>

<p>But the next day she did as she done every day
and no wool was spun. The day after she put wool
on the wheel and gave it a few turns. In a week
from that evening she had one ball of thread
spun.</p>

<p>"Your step-mother bids me ask you how much
of the wool have you spun?" said her husband
to her one evening. Bloom-of-Youth was so
much afraid that her husband would send her to
her step-mother through the dark, dark wood,
that she said "I have spun many balls."</p>

<p>"Your step-mother bade me count the balls
you have spun," said her husband.</p>

<p>"I will go up to the loft and throw them down
to you and then you will throw them back to me
and we will count them that way," said Bloom-of-Youth.</p>

<p>She went up to the loft and she flung down the
ball she had spun.</p>

<p>"One," said her husband, and he threw it back
to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>She flung him the ball again.</p>

<p>"Two," said her husband, and he flung it back
to her. Then he said "three," and then "four,"
and then "five," and so on until he had counted
twelve. "You have done well," said he, "and
now before the week is out take the twelve balls
to your step-mother's house and she will weave
the thread into cloth for clothes for me."</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 545px;">
<img src="images/image072.png" width="545" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>Bloom-of-Youth was greatly frightened. To
her step-mother's house she would have to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
with a dozen balls of thread in a few days. The
next day she hurried back from the well and she
sat at her wheel before the door spinning and
spinning. But, do her best, she could not get a
good thread spun in the long length of the day.</p>

<p>And while she was spinning and spinning and
getting her thread knotted and broken a black
and crooked woman came and stood before the
door. "You're spinning hard I see," said she to
Bloom-of-Youth.</p>

<p>Bloom-of-Youth gave her no answer but put her
head against the wheel and cried and cried.</p>

<p>"And what would you say," said the black and
crooked woman, "if I took the bundle of wool
from you now and brought it back to you to-morrow
spun into a dozen balls of thread?"</p>

<p>"It is not what I would say; it is what I should
give you," said Bloom-of-Youth.</p>

<p>"Give me!" said the black and crooked woman.
"What could you give me?" But as she said it
she gave Bloom-of-Youth a baleful look from under
her leafy eyebrows. "No, no, you need give me
nothing for spinning the wool for you. All that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
I'll ask from you is that you tell me my name
within a week from this day."</p>

<p>"It will be easy to find out her name within
a week," said Bloom-of-Youth to herself. She
took the bundle of wool out of the basket and
gave it to her. The black and crooked woman
put the wool under her arm and then she lifted
up her stick and shook it at Bloom-of-Youth.</p>

<p>"And if you don't find out my name within a
week you will have to give me your heart's blood&mdash;a
drop of heart's blood for every ball of wool I
spin for you." The hag went away then. Bloom-of-Youth
was greatly frightened, but after a
while she said to herself "I need not be afraid,
for in a week I'll surely find out the name of the
black and crooked woman who can't live far from
this."</p>

<p>The next day the hag came to the door and left
twelve balls of wool on the bench outside the
house. "In a week, in a week," said she, "you'll
have my name or I'll have twelve drops of your
heart's blood to make the leaves of my Elder Tree
fresh and fine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Bloom-of-Youth went with the twelve balls of
wool to her step-mother's house, and every person
she met on the way she asked if he or she knew the
name of the black and crooked woman. But no
one could tell her the hag's real name. All they
could tell was that she was the Witch of the Elders
and that she lived beside the Big Stones that were
at the other side of the wood.</p>

<p>Bloom-of-Youth was afraid: her face lost its
color and her eyes grew wide and her heart would
beat from one side of her body to the other. And
every day the Witch of the Elders would come
to the door and say "Have you my name yet,
Bloom-of-Youth, have you my name yet? Two
days gone, five to come on; three days gone,
four to come on; four days gone, three to come
on; five days gone, two to come on." Six days
went by and on the seventh she would have to go
to the Big Stones at the other side of the wood
and let the Witch of the Elders take twelve drops
of her heart's blood.</p>

<p>The night before the week's end her husband,
when he sat down by the fire said "I saw something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and I heard something very strange when
I was at the other side of the wood this evening."
"What was it you saw?" said Bloom-of-Youth.
"Lights were all round the Big Stones
and there was a noise of spinning inside the ring
they make. That's what I saw." "And what
was it you heard?" said Bloom-of-Youth. "Someone
singing to the wheels," said her husband.
"And this is what I heard sung.&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Spin, wheel, spin; sing, wheel, sing;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Every stone in my yard, spin, spin, spin;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Twelve drops from her heart will make my leaves shine!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How little she knows, the foolish thing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That my name is Bolg and Curr and Carr,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That my name is Lurr and Lappie.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"O sing that song again," said Bloom-of-Youth,
"Sing that song again."</p>

<p>Her husband sang it again, and Bloom-of-Youth
went to bed, singing to herself.&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My name is Bolg and Curr and Carr,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My name is Lurr and Lappie.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The next day as soon as her husband had gone
to his hunting Bloom-of-Youth went through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
wood and towards the Big Stones that were at
the other side of it. And as she went through
the wood she sang.&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Spin, wheel, spin; sing, wheel, sing;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Every branch on the tree, spin, spin, spin;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For loss of my heart's blood I'll never dwine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her name is Bolg and Curr and Carr,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her name is Lurr and Lappie.</span><br />
</p>

<p>She went singing until she was through the wood
and near the Big Stones. She went within the
circle. There, besides a flat stone that was on the
ground, she saw the black and crooked old woman.</p>

<p>"You have come to me, Bloom-of-Youth,"
said she. "Do you see the hollow that is in this
stone? It is into this hollow that the drops of
your heart's blood will have to run."</p>

<p>"The drops of my heart's blood may remain
my own."</p>

<p>"No, no, they won't remain your own any longer
than when it is plain you can't tell my name."</p>

<p>"Is it Bolg?" said Bloom-of-Youth.</p>

<p>"Bolg is one of my names," screamed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Witch of the Elders, "but one of my names won't
let you go free."</p>

<p>"Is it Curr?"</p>

<p>"Curr is another of my names, but two of my
names won't let you go free."</p>

<p>"Is it Carr?"</p>

<p>"Carr is another of my names, but three of my
names will not let you go free."</p>

<p>"I know your other names too," said Bloom-of-Youth.</p>

<p>"Say them, say them," screamed the Witch
of the Elders.</p>

<p>But when she tried to think of them Bloom-of-Youth
found that the last two names had gone
out of her mind. Not for all the drops that were
in her heart could she remember them.</p>

<p>"No, no, you can't say them," said the Witch
of the Elders. "And now bend your breast over
the hollow in the stone. I'll let out twelve drops
of your heart's blood with my pointed rod. Bend
your breast over the hollow."</p>

the Stones. It was the same tune as Bloom-of-Youth
had sung her song to as she went through
the wood. Now all the words in her song came
back to her.&mdash;</p>

<p>She said the last two names and as she did the
Witch of the Elders screamed and ran behind the
stones. Bloom-of-Youth saw no more of her.</p>

<p>That evening her husband brought home the
web of cloth that her step-mother had woven.
The next day Bloom-of-Youth began to make
clothes for him out of it. Never again did she
make delays at the well but she came straight home
with her pails of water. The fire was always clear
upon the hearth and she had never to light it
the second time and then sweep away the ashes
that had gathered on the floor. She made good
clothes for her husband out of the web of cloth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>

she spun on her wheel and there was never a time
afterwards when she had not a dozen balls of
thread in the house.</p>

Princess Bright Brow</h2>


<p class="figleft" style="width: 172px;">

</p>

<p>Everyone in and around
the King's Castle despised
Mell, the Hen-wife's Son, said
the Stonechecker, the bird that
built within the stones of the
Tower. And it was not because
there was anything mean
about the lad himself: it was
because his mother, the Hen-wife,
had the lowest office
about the King's Castle.</p>

<p>This is what a Hen-wife did:
She had to mind the fowl and
keep count of them, she had to
gather the eggs and put them
into a basket and send them
to the King's Steward every
day. And for doing this she
had as wages the right to go to the back-door of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the Steward's house and get from the under-servants
two meals a day for herself and Mell, her son.</p>

<p>And everybody, as I said, despised this son of
hers&mdash;horse-boys and dog-boys and the grooms
around the Castle. But of course no one despised
Mell more than did the King's daughter,
Princess Bright Brow.</p>

<p>She used to go into a wood and whisper along
the branch of a tree. And one day the Hen-wife's
son whom she despised so much made answer to
her. He was lying along the branch of the tree
watching his mother's goat that grazed on the
grass below. Now this is what Princess Bright
Brow said to the tree and this is what she used
to say to it every day.&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oak-tree, oak-tree, above the rest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which of the heroes loves me best?</span><br />
</p>

<p>Mell was lying along the Branch as I have said,
and he made answer back to her.&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Princess, Princess, he's at your call,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the Hen-wife's son loves you best of all!</span><br />
</p>

<p>The King's daughter looked up and she saw the
Hen-wife's son on the branch, and she went into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
a great rage. She gave orders to the grooms
that the Hen-wife's son was to be whipped every
time he looked at her. Many's the time after that
Mell got the lash. But he loved Bright Brow so
much that he could not forbear looking at her.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Now, one very early morning Mell took his
mother's goat out to graze on the green. And as
he went along he saw on the grass a beautiful
mantle. He took it up and he thought to himself
"How well it would look upon Princess Bright
Brow!" And he thought again "if she would
take this beautiful green mantle from me maybe
she would let me look upon her when she is wearing
it."</p>

<p>He put the mantle across his shoulders and sat
down and thought and thought. And while
he was thinking he felt the mantle being pulled
from behind. He turned round and he saw a
woman standing there. She had brighter colors
in her dress and she wore more ornaments than
any one he had ever seen in the King's Castle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
He knew by such signs that she was a Fairy
Woman out of the Green Rath.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/image088.jpg" width="448" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>"Mell," said she, "Mell, the Hen-wife's son,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
give to me the mantle that the King of the Fairy
Riders let fall from his shoulders last night."</p>

<p>"If it is his, and if you have come to bring it
to him, why you must have it," said Mell, and he
took the mantle off his shoulders and handed
it to her.</p>

<p>"The King would wish that I should recompense
you," said the Fairy Woman. She took
a jewel that was on the collar of the mantle and
gave it to Mell. "If you take this jewel in your
hand," said she, "and wish to be in this place or
that place you will be there in an instant, and
anyone you take by the hand you can bring with
you." And when Mell took the jewel from her,
the Fairy Woman, carrying the green mantle,
went into the green rath.</p>

<p>Then Mell took his goat by the horns and
turned towards his hut. And there, outside the
gate of the Castle he saw the King's daughter,
Princess Bright Brow. She was watching the
falconer training the young hawks and the grooms
and the riders of the Castle were behind her.
When she saw Mell with his hands on the goat's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
horns she grew high in rage and she turned to the
grooms to give an order that he be beaten with
the whips they held.</p>

<p>But Mell ran to her and he caught her hand
and holding the jewel he said "I wish that I was
in the Island of the Shadow of the Stars and that
this young girl was with me." The hawk flew
at him and the hound sprang at him and the whips
struck at him and while he was still expecting the
feel of teeth and claws and lash he was away
and was in another country altogether. There
was neither hawk nor hound nor hut nor castle
nor groom nor falconer. Two beings only were
there and they were Mell the Hen-wife's son and
the King's daughter, Princess Bright Brow.</p>

<p>"In what country are we?" said Princess Bright
Brow.</p>

<p>"Unless we are in the Island of the Shadow
of the Stars I don't know where we are," said
Mell, the Hen-wife's Son.</p>

<p>"You are the Hen-wife's son and you have
brought me here by enchantment," said Bright
Brow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>She wanted to go from him, but where was she
to go to? All the country was strange to her.
And so, if she made two steps away from him she
soon made two steps back to him. And the end
of this part of the story is that Bright Brow became
friendly to the Hen-wife's Son.</p>

<p>He gathered fruits off trees and he snared birds
and he took the fish out of rivers and he found
sheltered places to sleep in. And often the Princess
Bright Brow was good and kind to him. And
Mell the Hen-wife's son was now as happy as
anyone in the world. "Since we are so friendly
to each other now," said Bright Brow to him one
day, "will you not tell me how you were able to
come here and bring me with you?"</p>

<p>"It was because of the jewel I wear at my
breast," said Mell. And then he told how he had
found the green mantle on the ground and how
the Fairy Woman gave him the jewel and what
power the jewel had.</p>

<p>If Mell was content to be on the Island, Bright
Brow was not. And so one evening when he was
asleep she lifted up the mantle and took the jewel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
that was on his breast. Then holding it in her
hand she said "I wish I was back in my father's
Castle." In an instant she was back there. Now
all her maids were around her and all of them were
crying "Where have you been, King's daughter,
where have you been?" And Bright Brow told
them that the King of the Fairy Riders had taken
her away to show her all the great heroes of the
world so that when the time came for her to choose
a husband she could make her choice of the best
amongst them.</p>

<p>As for Mell, the Hen-wife's son: when he wakened
up and found that Bright Brow had gone
and that the jewel was gone there was no one in
the world more sad and lonely than he was. He
thought that she might come back to him, but
the moon came and the sun came and Bright Brow
came not. He longed to be a bird that he might
fly after her to her father's Castle.</p>

<p>He stayed on the Island of the Shadow of the
Stars for a long time for, now that the jewel was
gone from him, there was no way of getting from
the Island. Then a King who had built a high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
tower went to the top of it one day and saw the
Island of the Shadow of the Stars. He sent out
his long ships and his leathern-jerkined men to it.
They found Mell and they brought him to the
King. Then Mell became one of the King's men
and he went into battle and he learnt the use of
all arms.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The Hen-wife's son went through the Eastern
and the Western Worlds and he came back to
where his mother's hut was. He rode round the
walls of the King's Castle. Everything that he
thought was magnificent before seemed small to
him now. The trees that grew within the walls
seemed not much bigger than the bushes the old
women put clothes to dry on.</p>

<p>Sitting on his black horse he looked across the
wall that he once thought was so high and he saw
the Hen-wife's hut. His mother came out to feed
the hens and to count them and to gather up the
eggs and put them in a basket. "She's alive and
I'll see her again," said Mell. He rode round the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
wall to the King's Garden to try to get sight of
the Princess Bright Brow. He saw no sight of
her. He rode on and he came to the gate at the
other side and he saw outside the Cook-house the
horse-boys and dog-boys and grooms that he used
to know.</p>

<p>He saw them and he knew them, but they did
not know him. He was surprised to see that they
had not learnt to straighten up their shoulders
nor to walk as if there was a fine thought in their
heads. They were all around the Cook-house,
and a great noise of rattling was coming from
within it.</p>

<p>"What noise is that in the Cook-house?" Mell
asked a groom.</p>

<p>"The Cook's son is going out to fight," said
the groom, "and he is striking the pot-lids with
the ladles to let everyone in the Cook-house know
how fierce he is."</p>

<p>"And who is the Cook's son going to fight?"
asked Mell the Hen-wife's son.</p>

<p>"He is going to fight a great Champion that
has come up from the sea in a boat that moves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
itself. This Champion demands that the King
pay tribute to him. And the King has offered
his daughter and half his kingdom to the youth
who will go down to the sea-shore and defeat this
Champion. And to-day the Cook's son is going
out to make trial."</p>

<p>And while the groom was saying all this the
Cook's son came out of the Cook-house. His big
face was all gray. His knees were knocking each
other. The breastplate of iron he had on was
slipping to one side and the big sword he had put
in his belt was trailing on the ground.</p>

<p>"I would like to see what sort of a fight this
Champion will make," said Mell, the Hen-wife's
son. He followed the Cook's son to the sea-shore.
But the Cook's son, when he had come to the shore,
looked round and found a little cave in the face
of the rock and climbed into it.</p>

<p>Then a boat that moved of itself came in from
the sea, and a Champion all in red sprang out of
it. And when he had touched the shingles he
struck his sword on his shield and he shouted "If
the King of this Land has a Champion equal to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the fray let him forth against me. And if the
King of the Land has no such Champion, let him
pay me tribute from his Kingdom."</p>

<p>Mell looked to the cave where the Cook's son
had hidden himself and all he saw there was a
bush being pulled towards the opening to hide it.</p>

<p>Then Mell the Hen-wife's son drew his sword
and went down the beach towards the Red Champion.
They fought for half the day. At the end
of that time the Red Champion said "Good is
the champion that the King of this Land has
sent against me. I did not know he had such a
good champion."</p>

<p>They fought all over the strand making the
places that were stony, wet, and the places that
were wet, stony, and then, when the sun was going
down, the Red Champion was not able to do anything
more than guard himself from the strokes
of Mell's sword while he drew towards his boat.</p>

<p>"You will have the honors of the fight to-day,"
said he to Mell.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/image097.jpg" width="406" height="600" alt="The Red Champion said, &quot;Good is the Champion that the
King of this Land has sent against me.&quot;" title="The Red Champion said, &quot;Good is the Champion that the

<span class="caption">The Red Champion said, &quot;Good is the Champion that the

</p>

<p>"I shall have the honors and something else
beside," said Mell. Then he struck at the red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
plume that was on his enemy's cap. He cut it
off as the Red Champion sprang into the boat
that moved of itself. As the sun was sinking the
Champion in the boat went over the sea.</p>

<p>Now the Cook's son had been watching the
whole fight from the cave. When he saw the Red
Champion going off in his boat he came running
down to the shore. The Hen wife's son was lying
with his hands and his face in the water trying to
cool himself after the combat and the red plume
that he had struck off the Champion's cap was
lying near him. The Cook's son took up the plume.</p>

<p>"Let me keep this as a remembrance of your
fight, brave warrior," said he to the Hen-wife's
son.</p>

<p>"You may keep it," said Mell. Then with the
red plume in his hands the Cook's son ran back
towards the Castle.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Mell the Hen-wife's son put on his best garments
and he went to the Castle that evening and he
was received by the King as a champion from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
foreign parts. And the King invited him to supper
for three nights.</p>

<p>Princess Bright Brow was at the supper and
Mell watched and watched her. He saw that she
was pale and that she kept sighing. And of the
damsel who came to sit beside him at the table
Mell asked "Why is the King's daughter so sad
and troubled-looking?"</p>

<p>"She has reason for being sad and troubled,"
said the damsel who was called Sea Swan, "for
she thinks she may have to marry one whom she
thinks little of."</p>

<p>"Why should that be?" said Mell.</p>

<p>"Because her father has promised to give her
and half his Kingdom to the one who will defeat
the Red Champion who has come from across the
sea and who demands that the King give him
tribute from the land. And the only one who has
gone forth against the Champion is the Cook's
son&mdash;a gray-faced fellow that only a kitchen-maid
would marry. And if it happens that the Cook's
son overcomes the Red Champion, well then
Princess Bright Brow will have to marry him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>And later on Sea Swan said to Mell "The King's
daughter is so troubled that she would go away
to the Island of the Shadow of the Stars if she
had the jewel that would bring her there. She
had it once, but a Fairy Woman came out of the
green rath and made Bright Brow give it to her."</p>

<p>When the feast was at its height the King stood
up and bade the Cook's son come near the High
Chair and tell how he had fought with the Red
Champion that day. And the Cook's son came
up holding the red plume in his hand. He told a
story of how he had fought with the Red Champion
all the day and how he had beaten him to his boat
and how he had made him take his boat out to
sea, and how, as the Champion had sprung into
the boat, he had struck at him and had cut the
red plume from his cap. "And I shall go down the
sea-shore to-morrow," said the Cook's son very
bravely, "and if the Red Champion dares come
back I shall take off his head instead of his plume."
Then he left the red plume beside the King's
daughter and her father made Bright Brow hold
up her forehead for the Cook's son to kiss. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
all in the supper-room clapped their hands for the
Cook's son.</p>

<p>The next day Mell the Hen-wife's son stood
outside the Cook-house and he heard a tremendous
rattling within. "That is the Cook's son preparing
to go out to battle," said one of the grooms.
"He is striking the ladles upon the pot-lids to
show how fierce he is." Just as that was being
said the Cook's son walked out of the Cook-house.
He looked around him very haughtily. Then he
walked away with his big sword trailing behind
him and his breast-plate all to one side. Mell the
Hen-wife's son followed him.</p>

<p>When he came to the sea-shore he stood for a
while looking out to sea with his knees knocking
together. Then he went where he had gone the
day before. He climbed into a cave in the face of
the cliff and he drew the bush to the entrance of
it so that it was quite hidden.</p>

<p>Mell the Hen-wife's son looked out to sea and
he saw the boat that moved of itself come towards
the shore. The Red Champion was in it. He
sprang out on the strand, struck his sword on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
shield and made proclamation: Unless the King
of the Land sent a champion who could overthrow
him he would make him pay tribute for
his Kingdom.</p>

<p>Then down to meet him came Mell the Hen-wife's
son, his sword in his hand. He and the Red
Champion saluted each other and then they
fought together trampling over the beach, making
the soft places hard and the hard places soft
with the dint of their trampling. "A good champion,
by my faith you are," said the Red Champion
to Mell, when three-quarters of the day had
been spent in fighting. And after that the Red
Champion tried only to guard himself from the
thrusts and the strokes of Mell's sword. He drew
away from Mell and towards his boat. He put
his two feet in it and pushed away. "You have
the honors of the day's fight, champion," said he.
"I shall have something beside the honors,"
said Mell and he struck at the Red Champion's
belt. Down on the shingles fell the silver-studded
belt and the Red Champion pushed off in his boat.</p>

<p>When the Cook's son saw from his cave that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Red Champion had gone he came down to the
water's edge where Mell was lying with his face
and hands in the water to cool himself after the
combat. The silver-studded belt was lying beside
Mell. The Cook's son took it up without
saying a word and he went off towards the Castle.</p>

<p>That night Mell the Hen-wife's son sat by himself
in the supper room of the King's Castle. He
watched and watched the face of the Princess
Bright Brow. She looked more pale and troubled
than on the night before. And after the harpers
had played the King called upon the Cook's
son to come up to the High Chair and tell how he
had battled with the Red Champion. He came
up with the silver-studded belt in his hand and
he told a story of how he had beaten the Red
Champion back into the sea. And when the story
was told the King bade Bright Brow go over to
him and kiss the Cook's son on his heavy gray
cheek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The next day when he stood before the Cook-house,
Mell the Hen-wife's son heard a greater
rattling than before. The Cook's son struck
the pot-lids with the ladles more fiercely than
before and he cried out in a high voice "This
is the last time that I shall ever stand amongst
the pots and the pans, the lids and the ladles, for
I go to fight the Red Champion for the last time,
and after this I will sit beside the King's Chair
and the King's daughter, Princess Bright Brow,
will sit upon my knee."</p>

<p>He marched down to the sea-shore, his long
sword trailing behind him. He walked through
the street with his head high, but when he drew
near the sea-shore his gait became less grand. His
knees began to knock together. He looked out
to the sea and when he saw the boat that moved
of itself coming towards the shore he clambered
into the cave and he drew the bushes round to
cover up the entrance.</p>

<p>The boat that moved of itself came to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
strand. The Red Champion sprang out on the
shingles. He made his proclamation. Then up
to him came Mell the Hen-wife's son. "I will
strive with you," said he, "as I strove with you
yesterday and the day before. And how shall we
fight? Shall it be with swords or by wrestling?"
"By wrestling let it be to-day," said the Red
Champion.</p>

<p>They laid hands on each other and began to
wrestle. And in their bout of wrestling they made
holes in the ground and they made hillocks on the
ground, and when the day was about to close
Mell overthrew the Red Champion. He left him
stark on the ground. Then he took the cord he had
round his waist and he bound the Red Champion&mdash;hands
and feet, waist and chest he bound him.</p>

<p>The Cook's son came up to them then. "As
you took the red plume and as you took the silver-studded
belt, take the Champion too," said Mell.
Then the Cook's son took the Red Champion,
all bound as he was, and putting him across his
shoulders went staggering up the beach and towards
the King's Castle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Mell the Hen-wife's son sat in the supper-room
of the Castle again that night. The King's
daughter, Princess Bright Brow, was there and
she was as white as white rose-leaves and tears
were falling down her cheeks. And when the
wine had been drunk out of the cups the King
stood up and called upon the Cook's son to come
up to the High Chair and tell all how he had
overthrown and had bound the Red Champion
who would have put a tribute upon the Kingdom.
The Cook's son came up to the High Chair
and he told them a story that was wonderful
indeed. And when the story was told the King
said "Loose the Red Champion whom you bound,
and when he has knelt here and prayed to us for
forgiveness the King's daughter will take your
hands and will marry you." "Look," said the
damsel Sea Swan to Mell the Hen Wife's son,
"how the Princess Bright Brow is pulling the hairs
from her head in her grief."</p>

<p>The Red Champion was brought in bound and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the Cook's son began to try to unbind him. But
not one knot could he loosen. He tried and he
tried and he broke his nails trying. "This is
strange indeed," said the King, "for it used to be
said that whoever bound one could loosen one."</p>

<p>He tried again and he tried again and not one
cord could he loosen from another. Then the
King's daughter Princess Bright Brow looked up.
"How strange it would be," said she, "if it was not
the Cook's son who bound the Red Champion."</p>

<p>Then up the Hall came Mell the Hen-wife's son.
He stood over the Red Champion and he pulled
a cord here and he pulled a cord there and in a
minute he was unbound. All in the hall began to
murmur "Surely the one who unloosed him bound
him," said many people.</p>

<p>"He is the one who bound me," said the Red
Champion, pointing out Mell the Hen-wife's son,
"and besides it was he who cut the red plume off
my cap and who took the silver-studded belt
from me."</p>

<p>"Speak up and deny what he says," said the
King to the Cook's son.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>But when the Cook's son tried to speak he
stuttered and stammered and his knees began to
knock together and his hands went shaking. And
when the company looked at him there was not
one there who believed he had fought the Red
Champion. And when the Cook's son looked
round and saw there was not one there who believed
in him he gathered the supper-things of the
table like an attendant and went out of the room.</p>

<p>"And now," said the King to Mell, the Hen-wife's
son, "since there is no doubt but it was you
who conquered the champion to you I give my
daughter's hand. Take her now for your wife
and take half of my kingdom with her."</p>

<p>Then Bright Brow lifted her face to him and
she put her hands in his hands.</p>

<p>"Mell," said she, "Mell the Hen-wife's son, I
knew for long that you would come to me like
this. Forgive me and love me," said she, "and
I will love you from this night."</p>

<p>And so Mell the Hen-wife's son and the King's
daughter, Princess Bright Brow, came together
again. He married her and came to rule over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
half her father's kingdom. They lived happy
ever afterwards, of course. And Mell brought
his mother out of the hut beside the poultry-coop
and he took her to live in the Castle. And
in the end his mother married the Steward who
had become a widower and she became the most
respected dame in and about the King's Castle.
And as for the Cook's son he is still in the Cook-house
amongst the pots and the pans, the lids and
the ladles.</p>

<p>The Cock scraped and the
Hens scraped and when the
Hens went away the Cock
scraped by himself. He called
the Hens back, and they all
scraped deeper and deeper.
Then something was shown; it
was bright and round, and the
Cock and the three Hens scraped
until the whole of it was to be
seen. It was a great ring of brass.</p>

<p>"Tell us how you knew the
bright thing was there, Hero-son
of my heart?" said the Little
Slate-colored Hen that was
the Cock's mother.</p>

<p>"Do, do," said the Feather-legged
Hen.</p>

<p>"Tell us, Top of Wisdom," said the Blue Hen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"You all know," said the Cock, "that the earth
rocks underneath the place where I crow in the
morning."</p>

<p>"We know, O Unvanquishable," said the three
Hens.</p>

<p>"The earth never rocked here," said the Cock,
"hence I knew that something powerful was
under the ground at this place. It was the ring
of brass. Now it will be found and brought into
the house. And when I stand here and crow in
the morning the earth will rock as it does in every
other place in the world."</p>

<p>"It will, it will," said the Feather-legged Hen.</p>

<p>"It must, O Top of Valor," said the Blue Hen.</p>

<p>"And you will tell us how the ring of brass
came to be there, Hero-son of my heart," said the
Little Slate-colored Hen that was the Cock's
mother.</p>

<p>"In the course of the evening I may do so,"
said the Cock condescendingly.</p>

<p>When they were beside the sunny wall, the Hens
on the ground scattering dust over their feathers
and their lord standing on one leg with his comb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
hanging over one eye the Cock said "No Cock of
our breed ever told this story before. They would
not frighten the hens with it. However, since
you have persuaded me I will tell you the tale.
My grandfather told it to my father who told it
to me. It is the story of the Big Man who came to
this place and who wore the ring of brass that we
uncovered to-day."</p>

<p>He did not put it over his head as you might
think from the size of the ring. No. He wore it
on his arm. Never was a bigger man seen by anyone
living. The whole countryside stood outside
their houses to see him come over the hills. When
he came to where the stones are he stooped down
to take a drink and he drank the well dry. The
people came out of the house to meet him, and he
spoke to them, and out of what he said to them
they drew his story.</p>

<p>As I am to a Bantam, the Big Man was to
the other men of the country. And if they were
surprised at his bigness, he was astonished at
their smallness. For he came from a time when
all were as big as he. A hundred and a hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
years before he had hunted with his companions,
and he was then called, not Big Man, but Little
Fawn.</p>

<p>And one day&mdash;a hundred and a hundred years
ago it was&mdash;he had gone to chase a deer. The deer
fled into a cave. He followed with his hounds and
his sword, his trumpet and his missile-ball. He
went astray and fell asleep in the Cave. And when
he wakened up, his hounds were heaps of dust
beside him. He went into the world, and he found
that his companions were dead for a hundred and
a hundred years and that the men of the earth
had become smaller and smaller. In the Cave
he left his sword and his trumpet and his missile-ball.</p>

</p>

<p>The Cock put his two feet on the ground and
shook his red comb from over his left to over his
right eye. Then said he, Everyone in the house
was friendly to Little Fawn except one person&mdash;Murrish
the Cook-woman. From the first day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
he came there were disputes between them. "Big
men have big appetites," said she to him the day
he came, "and so to-night I will give you two
eggs for your supper." But when she handed him
the eggs Little Fawn said "It was not the eggs
of the hedge-sparrow we were wont to eat in my
time." "Eggs of the hedge-sparrow!" said Murrish,
"I have handed you the biggest eggs laid
by the best hens in the country." "In my time
there were bigger eggs in the nest of the hedge-sparrow,"
said Little Fawn.</p>

<p>The next day she gave him a barley-cake for
his breakfast. He ate it and then sent the boy&mdash;Ardan
was his name&mdash;to ask what else she was
going to give him.</p>

<p>"Give him!" said Murrish the Cook-woman,
"I have given him a whole barley cake, and that
is enough for two men's breakfasts."</p>

<p>"Tell her," said Little Fawn, "that I often saw
an ivy-leaf that was as big as her barley cake."</p>

<p>"Tell him," said Murrish the Cook-woman,
"that I am not here to listen to old mens' romances."</p>

<p>Now when he heard that his words were taken
as old men's romances Little Fawn was an angry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
man. He was hungry, for the food he got did not
stay his appetite, but what Murrish said in doubt
of his word gave him more hurt than his hunger
did. For in his day and amongst his companions
a lie was never told and nothing a man said was
ever doubted.</p>

<p>The next day he sent back the dish for more
butter.</p>

<p>"Tell him," said Murrish the cook-woman,
"that I put a whole pat of butter on his dish&mdash;enough
to do two men for two days."</p>

<p>"Tell her," said Little Fawn, "that often I saw
a rowan berry that was bigger as her pat of butter."</p>

<p>"The child just out of the cradle would not believe
that story," said Murrish the cook-woman.</p>

<p>She sent him a quarter of mutton for his
dinner. Little Fawn told Ardan to ask Murrish
for more, as the dinner she gave him left him
hungry still.</p>

<p>"Did he not get a whole quarter of mutton for
his dinner?" said Murrish.</p>

<p>"A whole quarter of mutton, did she say?"
said Little Fawn. "Often I saw a quarter of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
blackbird that was bigger than her quarter of
mutton."</p>

<p>"A quarter of a blackbird bigger than my
quarter of mutton! Tell him that if he never lied
before, he lies now," said Murrish.</p>

<p>"Does she say that?" said Little Fawn. "Then
I swear I shall never rest in the house nor be easy
in my mind until I bring her an ivy leaf that is as
big as her barley loaf, and a rowan berry that is as
big as her pat of butter, and if I bring these," said
he, "it may not be needful for me to get her the
blackbird that is as big in one quarter as the
quarter of mutton that she gave me for my dinner."</p>

<p>There and then he went from the house and
Ardan the boy went with him. They went east
and they went west, they went towards the north
and towards the south, but no ivy leaf did they
find that was as big as a barley loaf, and no rowan
berry did they see that was as big as a pat of
butter. Little Fawn was troubled and downcast.
They came back to the house, and Murrish
the Cook-woman was pleased when she heard
from Ardan that they found no ivy leaf and saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
no rowan berry that was as big as her barley loaf
or her pat of butter. "There is only one thing
I can do now," said Little Fawn, "and that is to
bring her the blackbird that is as big in one quarter
as the quarter of mutton she gave me for my
dinner. And that," said he to Ardan, "will take
time and trouble and the meeting of danger to
bring about."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Time and trouble," said the Feather-legged
Hen, "time and trouble!"</p>

<p>"Why did he say time and trouble, O Top of
Wisdom?" said the Blue Hen.</p>

<p>"Hush now," said the Little Slate-colored Hen
that was the Cock's mother. "Hush now, and let
the Hero-son of my heart tell what's best in the
story...."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Little Fawn was an old man, white-haired and
feeble when he came to the house," said the Cock,
and now he was nearly blind. His mind would
not be at rest, he told Ardan, until he brought
to Murrish and showed her a blackbird that was as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
big in one quarter as the quarter of mutton she
gave him for his dinner. "But before I can take
that blackbird," said he, "I must have a hound.
There is a hound in the yard, but I have tried
her and found she is weak and fearful. She will
have puppies, and one of her puppies, maybe, will
do." And he told Ardan to tell him when the
puppies came to the hound that was in the yard.</p>

<p>Then one day Ardan came and told him that
there was a litter of puppies with the hound.
"That is well," said Little Fawn, "and in a while
we will try if one has the strength and courage
enough to help us to take the blackbird."</p>

<p>He told Ardan what to do. He was to take
the skin that had been stripped off a dead horse
and he was to nail this skin upon a door in the
yard. Then he was to do a curious thing. He was
to take up each puppy and fling it against the
door.</p>

<p>Ardan did all this and Little Fawn stood by
and heard the puppies yowling as they fell on
the ground. They scampered away. Then he
heard nothing except Ardan's laugh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why are you laughing, my boy?" said Little
Fawn.</p>

<p>"I laugh to see what the last puppy is doing,"
said Ardan.</p>

<p>"And what is he doing?" said Little Fawn.</p>

<p>"He has not fallen to the ground like the others.
He has caught hold of the horseskin with his teeth
and he is holding on to it."</p>

<p>"That puppy will do," said Little Fawn. "He
has strength and courage. Take him and rear
him away from the others, and when he comes to
his full strength you and I will take him to hunt
the blackbird that is as big in one quarter as the
quarter of mutton Murrish the Cook-woman gave
me for my dinner. We must make our word good
this time, good lad." Ardan took away the puppy
(Conbeg they called him) from the others and
reared him up. Little Fawn tested his strength
and courage in many ways. At length he was
satisfied. One day he put a leash on Conbeg and
he told the boy to come with him. Little Fawn
and Ardan and Conbeg the young hound went
away from the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis the best part of the story," said the
Little Slate-colored Hen that was the Cock's
mother.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"It is, it is," said the Feather-legged Hen.</p>

<p>"And how well he tells it, the Top of Wisdom,"
said the Blue Hen.</p>

<p>"I tell it as my father told me and as his father
told him," said the Cock changing legs. "The
first place they went was into the Cave where the
Big Man had lain for a hundred and a hundred
years. They found there the heap of dust that
was his two hounds, and they found too the missile-ball
of brass and the trumpet and the great sword.
They left the Cave and they turned south, and
they went on and on till they came to the mountain
that is called Slieve-na-Mon. The boy and the
man and the hound rested themselves for a while
on the level on the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>Then Little Fawn told Ardan to take the
trumpet and put it to his mouth. He blew on the
trumpet. O louder than ever I crowed was the
noise he made on that trumpet. The trees that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
were growing on the mountain top shook at the
sound.</p>

<p>"Blow again," said Little Fawn.</p>

<p>And Ardan blew again and he blew louder.</p>

<p>"Now look into the sky," said Little Fawn,
"and tell me what you see coming towards us."</p>

<p>Ardan looked for a long time, and at last he
saw what he thought was a cloud coming towards
the mountain-top. And then he saw that the
cloud was a flock of birds. They came to the
mountain-top and lighted on the ground&mdash;Peewits,
Blackbirds, Starlings, Finches, Linnets&mdash;and each
was bigger than any bird he had ever seen. The
birds were hardly afraid of the hound, but Conbeg
went amongst them and drove them away.</p>

<p>And then another cloud was seen coming
across the sky, and this cloud came to be a flock
of birds too, and they came to the mountain-top
and lighted on the ground&mdash;Linnets, Finches, Starlings,
Blackbirds, Peewits&mdash;and each bird was bigger
than the birds in the first flock. "Loose the hound
on them," said Little Fawn. Ardan unslipped
Conbeg and the hound went amongst the birds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
But they were not afraid and they attacked the
hound, and only his strength and courage was so
great they would have driven him off the mountain-top.</p>

<p>They rose up and they flew away, and as they
did another flock of birds came towards the mountain-top.
They lighted on the ground&mdash;Peewits,
Blackbirds, Starlings, Finches, Linnets&mdash;tremendous
birds. Ardan loosed Conbeg on them. Then
with beaks open and claws outstretched they flew
at Ardan and Little Fawn. Little Fawn took his
great sword in hand and he attacked them with
such strength that the great birds flew off.</p>

<p>All flew from the mountain except one bird.
He was a Blackbird and the greatest amongst
them all. When Ardan told Little Fawn that this
bird was left alone on a rock the Big Man told
him to unloose Conbeg.</p>

<p>The hound dashed at the Blackbird but the
blackbird flew at him and attacked him with beak
and claws. With a sweep of his wing he threw
Conbeg on the ground. Then he rose up in the
air and flew towards Ardan and Little Fawn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will escape him," said Ardan, "but me he
will kill as he has killed Conbeg." "Put the missile-ball
into my hand and guide my aim," said
Little Fawn. Ardan put the missile-ball of brass
into the Big Man's hand and guided his aim.
Little Fawn threw the missile-ball and the Blackbird
fell down on the ground. But the bird was
not killed.</p>

<p>"A frightening tale, a frightening tale," said the
Blue Hen.</p>

<p>"So it is, so it is," said the Feather-legged Hen.</p>

<p>"But you have done well to tell the Hens the
story, Hero-son of my heart," said the Little
Slate-colored Hen that was the Cock's mother.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"More has to be told," said the Cock, "and it
is needful that it should be told now. Murrish
the Cook-woman was in the kitchen. In dashed
Conbeg the hound, his eyes blazing with the fierceness
of the chase. Murrish was so frightened that
she ran to the door. And coming to the door she
saw Little Fawn with a net on his shoulder. He
came into the house and he put the net on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
floor, and he showed Murrish what was in the net&mdash;a
tremendous bird&mdash;a Blackbird that was as
big in one quarter as the quarter of mutton she
had on the table. And when the net was laid
down on the ground the Blackbird flew up and he
carried the middle of the roof away with him as
he flew through it and he tumbled beams and
rafters down upon Murrish. My grandfather
saw the Blackbird flying towards the mountain
that is called Slieve-na-Mon, and my grandfather
told my father who told me." "You spoke the
truth when you said that you saw a blackbird as
big in one quarter as the quarter of mutton I gave
you for your dinner," said Murrish the cook-woman
to Little Fawn. "And I believe you when
you say you saw an ivy leaf as big as my barley
loaf and a rowan berry as big as my pat of butter."
"I would only show you," said Little Fawn "that
the men I lived amongst had truth on their lips
as they had strength in their hands and courage
in their hearts."</p>

<p>And from that day Little Fawn and Murrish
the Cook-woman lived in peace and good fellowship,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and Ardan and Conbeg grew up together
and became famous, one and the other. They
lived happy for long, but as the books say.&mdash;</p>

<p>The Sea-Swan told the story
to the pigeons of the rock,
and the Boy Who Knew What the
Birds said heard every word of
it. I was once a Sea-Maiden, she
said, and my name was Eevil,
and I was known through all the
Kingdoms that are Under-Wave
for my beautiful hair&mdash;my long,
beautiful, green hair. Something
was in me that made me want to
dance, and I used to rise up
through the water, and dance on
the shore of the island that is
called Hathony.</p>

<p>Mananaun, as you, creatures,
know, is Lord of the Sea, and
what he commands in the Kingdoms-Under-Wave
has to be. Now Mananaun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
made a promise to a King of an Earth-Kingdom,
and the promise was that he would give this King
whatever he asked for. The King died according
to the ways of men, and his son, whose name was
Branduv, came to rule him.</p>

<p>Branduv called Mananaun out of the sea, and
he asked that he renew the promise he had made
to his father. The Lord of the Sea did not want
a promise to lapse because of the death of a man,
and he renewed it to the man's son. Then Mananaun
told him he would take him and show him
the Kingdoms of the Sea and whatever he saw
that he desired there would be given to him. He
took him in his boat of glass "The Ocean Sweeper"
to visit the Kingdoms of the Sea.</p>

<p>They came to Moy Mell, the Plain of Pleasure,
and there Mananaun gave Branduv a branch of
everlasting blossoms; they came to another Kingdom
and there Mananaun gave him a sword that
was the best wrought in the world; they came to
a third Kingdom and there Mananaun gave him
a pair of hounds that could run down the silver-antlered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
stag. But as yet Branduv the King had
asked no gift from Mananaun.</p>

<p>They came to Mananaun's own Kingdom,
Silver-Cloud Plain, and there Branduv was left
alone while Mananaun drank the Ale of the Ever-Living
Ones. The King saw from the shores of
Silver-Cloud Plain "The Ocean Sweeper," and
he directed that the boat bring him to the island.
And the boat travelled as the one in it wished.</p>

<p>Only one thing had ever made me fearful of
dancing on the shore of the Island of Hathony&mdash;that
was the presence there of a pair of Ravens.
These Ravens had once been Sea-maidens, but they
had desired men for husbands, and they had gone
to them. The men forsook them, and they had
become first Witches and afterwards Ravens. Ever
since their change they wished harm to the Maidens
of the Sea. I had been frightened of them,
but now I had seen them flapping about so often
that I was no longer or I was only a little, afraid.</p>

<p>I came up through the sea and I danced upon
the shore of the island, and the play of the waves
was in my dance, and my long soft green hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
fell over my foam-white, foam soft body. I
danced on, O my listeners, and as no one had ever
seen me looked upon, I thought no one looked
upon me now.</p>

<p>But this King of the earthly Kingdom saw me.
He saw me as I danced by the waves, and I was
the fairest thing he had ever looked upon. At
first he was all wonder and no robber's thoughts
were in his mind. But the Ravens came to him.
One perched on one shoulder and one perched on
the other, and one said "If you carry Eevil off you
will have the fairest wife in all the world," and the
other said "If you leave her here you will never
look on anything as fair again."</p>

<p>The Ravens flapped before him to guide him to a
place in the dark rocks where he might hide and
to which I might come. He followed where they
led. But I saw his shadow on a rock. I drew
back and the sea took me and drew me into its
depths. "The sea has taken her," said Branduv
to the Ravens.</p>

<p>"Mananaun is Lord of the Sea," said one of the
Ravens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Mananaun has promised you a gift, and
he cannot refuse what you will ask," said the
other Raven.</p>

<p>Then the Ravens flapped away and Mananaun
came to where the
King was standing.
"You have asked me
for a gift," said Mananaun,
"think now
of what you desire
before I take you
back to your own
island." Then said
Branduv, "What I
ask is that you bestow
upon me the Sea-maiden
who was dancing here, Eevil."</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 227px;">
<img src="images/image137.jpg" width="227" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>Mananaun in anger lifted his spear. But then
he remembered he was bound by a promise to
Branduv. He lowered the spear he had raised. "I
will give you any other gift you ask," said he, "even
my own boat 'The Ocean Sweeper.'"</p>

<p>"I hold you to your promise," said Branduv,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
"and I declare to you that I shall take no other
gift unless it be the maiden who was here dancing
by the sea."</p>

<p>"It must be then that I give her you," said Mananaun,
and his face was dark.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/image138.png" width="411" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>Down he went to the Kingdom-Under-Wave
and he came to the black mansion where lived the
Seven Spinning Women of the Sea. He spoke
as speaks a King who has a hard thing to do.
"A law has to be broken," said he. "What law,
Lord?" said the Spinning Women. "The law
that saves our Maidens from taking part in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
stormy lives of men." "We would rather that
anything else but this should happen, Lord,"
said the Seven Spinning Women. "This thing
must happen," said Mananaun, "and the Maiden
Eevil must go to Branduv the King." "She must
be prepared for this," said the Seven Spinning
Women.</p>

<p>They came to me and they told me that the
man whose shadow I had seen on the rock now
claimed me for his wife and that Mananaun would
not gainsay him. When I heard this, O my listeners,
the life nearly left me.</p>

<p>This comfort the Seven Spinning Women gave
me: I was to stay on his island so that I might
become used to the earthly kingdom, but that I
was not to see Branduv until the green had left
my hair and the brown that the sun makes had
come into my cheeks. So I came to Branduv's
island. I lived by the sea-shore and the women of
the island attended me.</p>

<p>How different was this earthly land from the
Kingdom-Under-Wave. With us there was but
the one mild season, the one mild light. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
there was glaring day and terrible darkness,
bitter winds and hot beams of the sun. With
us there were songs and tales, but the songs were
about love or about the beautiful things we had
seen. Here the tales and songs were about battles
and forays and slaying with the sword. What they
told of their loves was terrible, so much violence
and unfaithfulness was in them.</p>

<p>The soft green tints were going out of my hair
and the sun was putting brownness in my cheeks.
Soon my hair would be wheaten-colored like the
hair of the women of the islands and my cheeks
would be brown like theirs. And then the day
would come when I should have to be with the
man whom I looked upon as my enemy.</p>

<p>I used to stay by the shore and speak with the
birds that came in from the sea, for I knew their
language. Never again could I go back to the
Kingdom-Under-Wave. Green shade after green
shade left my hair, brown tint after brown tint
came into my cheeks, and what could I do but
envy the birds that could make their flight from
the islands of men. And when the green had
nearly gone altogether from my hair I thought of a
desperate thing I might do.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/image141.jpg" width="405" height="600" alt="I put it to my lips, I drank it when he took a step towards me." title="I put it to my lips, I drank it when he took a step towards me." />
<span class="caption">I put it to my lips, I drank it when he took a step towards me.</span>
</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p>I sent a message to my sisters, and I sent it by
many birds, so that if they did not get it by one
they might get it by another. And I asked in my
message that they send me a draft from the Well
under the Sea, and that they send it in the cup that
the Seven Spinning Women guarded. It would
be terrible for any of my sisters to come to Branduv's
island with the draft and the cup, but I
begged that they would do it for me.</p>

<p>The days went by and the green color was now
only a shade in my hair, and brownness was on
my cheeks, and the women said "Before this old
moon is gone our King will come here to wed
you."</p>

<p>Then one day I found on the shore the cup that
my sisters had brought and the draft from the
Secret Well was in it. I took the cup in my hands
and I brought it where I lived. "Come to us,"
said the women, "so that we may undo your hair
and tell the King when he may come to wed you."
They loosened my hair and then they said "there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
is no shade of green here at all. Bid the King
come as early as he likes to-morrow."</p>

<p>I lay that night with the cup beside me. When
I rose I knew that day I should drink from the
cup my sisters had sent me&mdash;drink the draft that
would change me into what I wished to be&mdash;a bird
of the sea.</p>

<p>And while I sat with the cup beside me and my
hair spread out, Branduv, the King of the Island,
came to the door of the house. It may have been
that I was becoming used to the sight of people of
the earthly kingdoms, for, as I looked upon him
he did not seem terrible to me. He looked noble,
I thought, and eager to befriend me and love me.
But the cup was in my hands when he came to the
door. I put it to my lips when he entered the house.
I drank it when he took a step towards me. And
thereupon I became what I had wished to be&mdash;a
Sea-Swan.</p>

<p>O my listeners! Maybe it would have been well
for me if I had wed that King, and be now as the
women of the islands. For now as I fly over the
sea the King's look comes before me, and I think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
that he was eager to befriend me and eager to love
me. So I am not content when I am flying over
the sea. And I am lonely when I am on these
islands, for I am now a Swan, and what has a
Swan to do with the lives of men?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Such was the story that the Sea-Swan told the
pigeons of the rock, and the Boy who knew what
the Birds said heard it all, and remembered every
word of it.</p>

When the Crow Came to Steal the Peacock's Feathers</h2>


<p class="figleft" style="width: 201px;">

</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Said the Lapwing "Crow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I never have seen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such a one as you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such a one as you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For stealing eggs."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Said the Crow "Caw, caw,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I never have seen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such a one myself,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I am, I am sure</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Longer in the world."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Then the Crow flew away
and the Lapwing went on
complaining.</p>

<p>The Crow flew away and
he came to where the Peacock
was walking in the
King's Garden. He asked the
Peacock did he ever listen to stories.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said the Peacock as he mounted the
steps of the terrace. "No. Certainly not. I do
not demean myself by listening to any of the
stories they tell down below there." He spread
out his tail, and, that he might view his own magnificence,
he turned his blue, shining neck.</p>

<p>Hoodie the grey-headed Crow with the bright
sharp eyes hopped after him.</p>

<p>"Jewels! Kings! Magicians! Palaces! Dragons!
What do geese, grouse and farmyard fowl know
of such things? And yet they presume to tell
stories! Tell stories that have nothing in them
of Jewels, Kings, Magicians, Palaces, or Dragons!"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all about such things," said Hoodie
the Crow, as he plucked a feather out of the Peacock's
tail.</p>

<p>"Yet they will not listen to me," said Purpurpurati
the Peacock. "They affect even to scorn
my voice! They pretend that it is less resonant
than the cock in the farmyard and less musical
than the bird's that sings at night."</p>

<p>"They'd say anything," said Hoodie the Crow,
keeping behind the Peacock's tail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Purpurpurati the Peacock mounted higher on
the terrace. "I shall walk before the statue of
the beautiful Queen yonder," he said, "and I shall
tell you a story. The reason that I shall tell you
is that the Queen always listens to me. But I
would have her think that it is to you that I am
telling the story."</p>

<p>"I'll listen to you," said Hoodie the Crow and he
plucked another feather out of the Peacock's tail.</p>

<p>"When the Queen has been pleased with the
sight of my tail, I shall begin," said Purpurpurati,
and he spread out his tail. Hoodie the Crow
plucked out three feathers.</p>

<p>"How pleased she looks," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is always pleased by my appearance,"
the Peacock said, and he turned round and
walked the other way.</p>

<p>"Did I ever tell you," said Hoodie, hiding the
feathers behind a bush. "Did I ever tell you
how the Pigeon went to the Crow to learn the art
of nest-making?"</p>

<p>"I do not know about such things," said Purpurpurati
the Peacock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you and then you'll know," said Hoodie
the Crow.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 164px;">
<img src="images/image152.png" width="164" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Crow is the Master-builder among the Birds and
so it was to the Crow that the
Pigeon went to learn the art of
nest-making. "We begin with
the sticks," said the Crow. "I
know," said the Pigeon. "First
we take one stick and lay it
lengthwise." "I know," said the
Pigeon. "Then we put a stick
across it," said the Crow. "I
know," said the Pigeon. "And
then we put another stick lower down," said the Crow.
"I know," said the Pigeon. "Then we put another
stick lengthwise." "I know," said the Pigeon. "Musha,"
said the Crow, "If you know so much, why do
you come here at all? Away with
you! Fly home now and build
the nest yourself." The Pigeon
flew home, but of course he was
not able to build his nest, for he
knew nothing about the laying
of sticks and the bringing of
straws, and he was too young
and foolish to learn when he got the chance. And that
is why the Pigeon to this day cannot build a nest.</p></div>

</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why do you tell such foolish stories?" said
Purpurpurati the Peacock when Hoodie had
finished.</p>

<p>"We have no other stories in our family," said
Hoodie the Crow. "We don't know about Jewels
and Magicians and Palaces and Kings and Dragons."</p>

<p>"The Magician," said Purpurpurati the Peacock,
"The Magician lived in a Palace of red
marble that was all surrounded by a forest of
black, black trees. I lived there too and I ate
golden grains out of pails of silver. That was long
ago and it was in far India.</p>

<p>"The Magician had precious stones of every kind
and he would have me walk beside him to the
Cavern where he kept his precious stones, and as
he handled them over he would tell me of the
virtues that each stone possessed. And one day
the Magician looking upon me said 'This Peacock
I will slay, for the beauty of his neck makes dull
my turquoises and the crest on his head is more
shapely than my Persian jewel-work.'"</p>

<p>"Dear me, dear me!" said Hoodie the Crow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Hearing him say this, said the Peacock "I flew
into the branches of a dark, dark tree. And as
I rested there the fair lady who walked about the
Garden&mdash;White-as-a-Pearl she was called and she
was the Magician's daughter&mdash;walked under the
dark, dark trees, and I saw that she was weeping.</p>

<p>"I knew why she wept. She wept for the young
man whom her father had imprisoned in a tower.
This young man was the son of a King, and the
Magician was his father's brother. And if the
young man died the Magician would become King
in his brother's Kingdom. But the lady White-as-a-Pearl
did not want the young man to die.</p>

<p>"A little snow-white dove flew down from the
tower and spoke in words to White-as-a-Pearl
and asked her what word she had to send to the
young man.</p>

<p>"'You must tell him terrible news, my little
snow white dove,' said White-as-a-Pearl. 'My
father will have him go forth to fight with a dragon.
And this is a terrible dragon. Every young man
who has gone forth against him has been slain.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">

by which a hero can slay a dragon?</span>
</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"The little snow white dove flew back to the
tower and the Princess White-as-a-Pearl stood
under the dark, dark trees and wept again. And
when she saw me on my branch she said 'O most
beauteous of all the birds, do you know of any
arms by which a hero can slay a terrible dragon?'</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 262px;">
<img src="images/image157.png" width="262" height="100" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>"Then I came down off my branch and I walked
beside the Princess, and as I walked beside her
I told her the wonderful secrets I knew."</p>

<p>"And what were the secrets," said Hoodie the
Crow plucking a last feather from the peacock's
tail. "What were the secrets anyway?"</p>

<p>"Can I tell them to a Crow?" said Purpurpurati
the Peacock. "But I will tell them. I told her the
secrets I had learnt from the Magician when he
spoke of the virtues of his precious stones&mdash;a ruby
in a man's helmet would make a dragon's eyes go
blind. A turquoise on his arm would make a
dragon's blood turn to water. A sapphire on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
spear would make a dragon's heart burst within
him.</p>

<p>"So the Princess White-as-a-Pearl went to her
father's cavern and took the precious stones I
spoke of and gave them to the King's son. And
he went forth the next day and when he came to
him the dragon's eyes were blinded, and his blood
turned to water and his heart burst within him.
And the King's son cut off his head and brought it
into the Palace. Then the Magician fled amongst
the dark, dark trees and I was given the red
marble palace to live in."</p>

<p>"I lived in Lapland," said Hoodie the Crow.
"And who do you think I knew there?"</p>

<p>"No one of any dignity," said Purpurpurati
the Peacock.</p>

<p>"I knew your White-as-a-Pearl. She had become
an old ugly witch-woman."</p>

<p>"Base crow!" said Purpurpurati and he walked
up the steps and went away.</p>

<p>Then Hoodie the Crow dressed himself in the
feathers he had stolen from the Peacock and
went away and walked across the field admiring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
himself. But a Fox that had promised to bring a
Peacock to his Mother-in-law saw Hoodie the
Crow and stole up beside him and caught him in
his mouth and carried him away. And that was
the end of Hoodie who was such a clever crow.
"This Peacock is very tough," said the Fox's
Mother-in-law as she ate Hoodie. "What would
your Ladyship have?" said Rory the Fox. "Peacock
is always tough."</p>

<p>Kingfisher-all-Blue
used to sit on the branch
that went furthest across the
stream with his head bent down
and looking as if he were trying
to think his head off. Only in
the most lonesome places, far
from where the hens cackled
and the geese gabbled and the
cocks crew, would the Boy Who
Knew What the Birds Said find
him. And when he did find him
Kingfisher-all-Blue would not
open his beak to say one word&mdash;no,
not even when the Boy
would say "Where did you get
your beautiful color?" and
"Why is your beak so big,
little Kingfisher-all-Blue?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Now one day when he had left behind him the
hens that cackled, the geese that gabbled and the
cocks that crew, and had left behind him too the
old raven that built in the lone tree he came where
Kingfisher-all-Blue sat upon the slenderest branch
that went farthest across the stream. And when
Kingfisher-all-Blue saw him he lifted up his head
and he fixed his eye upon him and he cried out the
one word "Follow." Then he went flying down
the stream as if he were not a bird at all but a
streak of blue fire.</p>

<p>Kingfisher-all-Blue went flying along the stream
and the Boy Who Knew What the Birds Said was
able to follow him. They went on until the stream
they followed came out on the sand of the sea-shore.
Then Kingfisher-all-Blue seated himself
on a branch that was just above where the grains
of sand and the blades of grass mixed with each
other and he fixed his eye on a mound of sand and
clay. And when the Boy Who Knew What the
Birds Said came beside him Kingfisher-all-Blue
said the one word "Find."</p>

<p>Then the Boy Who Knew What the Birds Said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
began to take the sand and clay from the mound.
He worked all day at it and Kingfisher-all-Blue
sat on the branch above and watched him. And
at evening, when all the sand and clay had been
taken away by him the Boy Who Knew What
the Birds Said came upon a stone that was as big
and as round as the wheel of a cart.</p>

<p>And when he had brushed away the grains of
sand that was on the round stone he saw a writing.
The writing was in <span class="smcap">Ogham</span>, but at that time even
boys could read <span class="smcap">Ogham</span>. And the Ogham writing
said <span class="smcap">You Have Luck To Have Seen This Side Of
The Stone But You Will Have More Luck
When You See the Other Side</span>.</p>

<p>When he read that he looked up to where the
bird sat, but Kingfisher-all-Blue only said "I am
done with you now," and then he flew back along
the stream like a streak of blue fire.</p>

<p>The Boy Who Knew What the Birds Said stayed
near the stone until the dark was coming on. Then
he thought he would go home and in the morning
he would speak to Pracaun the Crow and ask her
about the stone that Kingfisher-all-Blue had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
brought him to and what good luck there was at
the other side of it.</p>

<p>Pracaun the Crow came to the standing stone in
the morning and ate the boiled potato that the Boy
Who Knew What the Birds Said brought her, and
then the Boy spoke to her about the stone that
Kingfisher-all-Blue had brought him to, and he asked
what good luck there was at the other side of it.</p>

<p>"Kingfisher-all-Blue has brought you to good
luck that none of the rest of us could have shown
you," said Pracaun the Crow. "Under that round
stone is the treasure of King Labraid Lorc."</p>

<p>"Who was King Labraid Lorc and what was
his treasure?" said the Boy Who Knew What the
Birds Said.</p>

<p>"I will tell you first about King Labraid Lorc,"
said Pracaun the Crow. "He was King of this part
of the country and of two lovely Islands that are
now sunken deep in the sea. Mananaun Mac Lir
who is Lord of the Sea was his friend and Labraid
Lorc would have been a happy King only for&mdash;well,
I'll tell you in a while what troubles he had.</p>

<p>"No one knew where the King had come from.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
He was not born King of this part of the country
nor of the lovely Islands that are now deep sunken
under the sea. Mananaun who is Lord of the Sea
had given him the Islands, or rather he had given
him the two keys that had brought the Islands up
from the bottom of the sea. Two silver keys they
were, O lad. And when they were brought together
they struck each other and rang like bells. And
"Labraid Lorc is King, King of the two Fair Islands"
is what they chimed out. As long as he held
the keys the Islands would remain above the water.
But if he put the keys away the Islands would
sink back into the sea.</p>

<p>"Once in every month the King had a man killed.
This is how it was. He would have a man to shave
his beard and to trim his hair. This man never
came alive out of the King's Castle. As soon as
the poor barber left the King's chamber and passed
down the hall soldiers would fall upon him and kill
him with their swords. Every time when the
King's beard was shaved and his hair was trimmed
a man was killed&mdash;twelve men in a year, a hundred
and forty-four men in twelve years!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now a warning came to a woman that her son
would be called upon to be the next barber to the
King. She was a widow and the young man was
her only son. She was wild with grief when she
thought that he would be killed by the soldiers'
swords as soon as he had shaved the King's beard
and trimmed the King's hair.</p>

<p>"She went everywhere the King rode. She threw
herself before him and asked for the life of her son.
And at last the King promised that no harm would
befall her son's life if he swore he would tell no
person what he saw when he shaved the King's
beard and trimmed the King's hair. After that he
would be always the King's barber.</p>

<p>"The widow's son came before the King and he
swore he would tell no person what he saw when
he shaved his beard and trimmed his hair. Then
he went into the King's Chamber. And when he
came out from it the King's soldiers did not fall
upon him and kill him with their swords. The
widow's son went home out of the Castle.</p>

<p>"His mother cried over him with joy at seeing
him back. The next day he went to work at his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
trade and his mother watched him and was contented
in her mind. But the day after her son
only worked by fits and starts, and the day after
that he did no work at all but sat over the fire
looking into the burning coals.</p>

<p>"And after that the widow's son became sick and
lay on his bed and no one could tell what was the
matter with him. He became more and more ill
and at last his mother thought that he had only
escaped the soldiers' swords to come home and
die in his house. And when she thought of that
she said to herself that she would go see the Druid
who lived at the back of the hill and beg him to
come to see her son and strive to cure him. The
Druid came and he looked into the eyes of the
young man and he said 'He has a secret upon his
mind, and if he does not tell it he will die.'</p>

<p>"Then his mother told the Druid that he had
sworn not to tell any person what he saw when he
shaved the King's beard and trimmed the King's
hair, and that what he saw was his secret. Said
the Druid 'If he wants to live he will have to
speak out his secret. But it need not be to any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
person. Let him go to the meeting of two roads,
turn with the sun and tell his secret to the first
tree on his right hand. And when he feels he has
told his secret your son will get the better of his
sickness.'</p>

<p class="figright" style="width: 214px;">

</p>

<p>"When this was told to the young man he got up
off his bed and he walked
to where two roads met.
He turned as the sun turns
and he whispered into the
branches of the first tree
on his right hand. And
the secret that he whispered
was 'King Labraid
Lorc has the ears of a
horse.' Then he turned
from the tree and he went
home. He slept, and in the
morning when he woke he
was well and he went to
his work and he was happy and cheerful.</p>

<p>"But the tree that he whispered his secret to was
a willow, and, as you know, out of the branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of the willow the harp is made. As the widow's
son went away a Harper seeking wood to make a
new harp came that way. He saw the willow and
he knew that its branches were just right for the
making of his harp. He cut them and he bent
them and he formed a harp from them. And
when the harp was firmly fixed the Harper came
with it to the King's Castle.</p>

<p>"The King gave a feast so that the first music
that came from the harp should be honored. He
made the Harper sit near his own High Chair.
Then, when the feast was at its height he called
upon the Harper to stand up and strike the first
music from the new harp.</p>

<p>"'The first music from the new harp shall be
praise of the King,' said the Harper when he stood
up. He drew his fingers across the strings and all
listened for the first music that would come. But
the harp that was made out of the willow branches
that the widow's son had whispered to murmured
'Labraid Lorc has the ears of a horse, Labraid
Lorc has the ears of a horse.' The King started
up from his High Chair. The Harper threw down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the harp. Everyone was silent in the hall. Then
one voice was heard saying 'It is true. The King
Labraid Lorc has the ears of a horse.'</p>

<p>"The King had the man who said it taken by his
soldiers and flung from the top of the Castle. No
one else spoke. But the next day when he rode
abroad the King heard the people behind the
hedges saying 'Labraid Lorc has the ears of a
horse.'</p>

<p>"After that, whenever he came near them, people
went from him, and at last no one was left in his
Castle. And there was no one to take him over
to the fair Islands that Mananaun, Lord of the
Sea, had given him for a possession. And there was
no one to bring over the fruits that grew on the
islands nor the cattle and sheep that pastured there.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Ernan is Lord, is Lord of the Fair Islands.&quot;</span>
</p>

<p>"Then the King went to Mananaun, Lord of the
Sea, and he offered him back the keys Mananaun
had given him&mdash;the silver keys that struck each
other when they were brought together and rang
like bells, chiming out 'Labraid Lorc is King, is King
of the two Fair Islands.' But no gift that Mananaun
gives is ever taken back and the keys were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
still left with Labraid Lorc. Yet he thought he
would let the keys go out of his possession so that
the Fair Islands would sink back into the sea.
But that they might not stay at the bottom of the
sea for ever he took the keys and he put them in
a pit at the sea-shore and he covered the pit with
a round stone, and knowing that it would be only
a lucky person who would come to that stone, he
wrote in Ogham writing on it <span class="smcap">You Have Luck
To Have Seen This Side of the Stone But
You Will Have More Luck When You See
The Other Side</span>.</p>

<p>"As he left the silver keys there the Fair Islands
began to sink in the water. So slow were they in
sinking that the cattle and sheep that pastured
on the islands were taken off in boats and the
people who lived in villages on the Islands came
away with all they owned. But at last the Islands
sank altogether out of sight. And after they went
down into the sea King Labraid Lorc was seen no
more.</p>

<p>"'And you, O Boy, are the lucky one that the
King hid the silver keys for. When you take them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
into your hands the Islands will begin to rise above
the water and when they are altogether risen and
are called the Fair Islands again you will be Lord
of them. And Kingfisher-all-Blue, the one we
thought had no care but for himself, brought you
to this good fortune.'"</p>

<p>Day after day the Boy Who Knew What the
Birds Said went down to the sea-shore and worked
to lift up the round stone that was over the pit
in which King Labraid Lorc had put his silver
keys. And one day he was able to raise up the
stone. There lay the great keys, shining in their
silver brightness. He took them up, and when he
brought them near each other they struck together
and they rang like bells. "Mananaun" was the
the name they chimed out. And they chimed
again "Ernan is Lord, is Lord of the Fair Islands."</p>

<p>Looking out to sea, the boy Ernan saw waters
rising up as though whales were spouting fountains.
And the next day, when he came to the sea-shore,
he saw that Islands had risen and that they were
already covered with green.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>No longer he listened to what the Birds said
but he watched the Islands every day and he saw
trees and grass come upon them. And when the
people came and said "Who can be Lord of these
Islands?" he held up the silver keys and brought
them together so that they struck each other and
rang like bells. "Ernan is Lord, Lord of the Fair
Islands" was what they chimed out. Each day
the Islands grew fairer in the sight of the people,
and Ernan was called, not "The Boy Who Knew
What the Birds Said," but "Ernan, Lord of the
Fair Islands."</p>
